c07,"October 2, 1847",It is so quiet in the house.
c09,"December 1, 1847","I felt tears gather in my eyes when he said it, and Fanny slipped an arm around my waist and said she would miss me."
c05,"August 1, 1847","If I leave, how will Michael or my uncle find me?"
c02,"May 1, 1847",The secret is this: The rude Keenan girl is a boy!

c09,"December 1, 1847","He, like me, had only one brother left in this world."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I felt so sorry for her that I asked Sister if I could help her.
c03,"June 1, 1847","“Come above,” Da said."
c07,"October 2, 1847","I think she is silent because her parents are silent, and that she demands to sleep in their room to watch over them."
c04,"July 3, 1847","When I first saw her, my heart soared."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I dread telling him my news, but still I wish he would come."
c07,"October 2, 1847",It is nice to have a place in the world.
c05,"August 1, 1847","I make myself useful there, and it reminds me that there are many in this world who are worse off than I. Nothing much to write."

c02,"May 1, 1847",Mrs. Tattersall agreed even though Mr. Tattersall said it was nothing.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Lyons asked me to tell her a story.
c07,"October 2, 1847",I am grateful that Mrs. Hall is slowly coming back to herself.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I am to sleep on a small cot in the kitchen and to be responsible for stirring up the fire and boiling the kettle first thing each morning.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I let out a howl.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Many people are excited to hear this, but I am not."
c08,"November 4, 1847","“They are asleep in each other’s arms,” she said."
c08,"November 4, 1847",This put Mrs. Lyons’s nose out of joint.
c06,"September 1, 1847","We shouted out every name we knew that began with those letters, but Fanny rejected any boy she knew with those names and wanted to try again."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I clean again.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mrs. Fenton and Fanny will come back to help me pack what is needed.
c07,"October 2, 1847","I would never say so to Mrs. Hall, but she seems to weaken with every bout of fever."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Had falling boxes crushed someone?
c02,"May 1, 1847","My feet are sore, my legs ache and my stomach growls like a wild beast."
c03,"June 1, 1847",I looked down and saw a body floating in the water.
c09,"December 1, 1847","But now that things had changed, she was free to be with her niece and to welcome the new babe."
c02,"May 1, 1847","I did not have to ask where he had heard this, for Connor nodded with every word."
c04,"July 3, 1847",This is not the great adventure I had expected.
c05,"August 1, 1847","At the last minute I was called upstairs to assist Claire, who had been scolded for being overly slow in tidying the parlour and the front hall."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I think that is why I chose to tell her the story of the Beautiful Maiden and her Three Aunts.
c04,"July 3, 1847","It was a crew member who, with one of his mates, was removing a passenger who had died in the night."
c06,"September 1, 1847","This will mean much cooking and baking, both on the cookstove and over the hearth."
c09,"December 1, 1847",I hope Mr. Hall is not worse.
c04,"July 3, 1847","The driver, Pierre, is French but speaks English very well."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Her face was sharp as she told me that I had been missed.
c05,"August 1, 1847",It was so nice to have someone to talk to for a change.
c03,"June 1, 1847",She did not move.
c04,"July 3, 1847","That, at least, was a small blessing."
c05,"August 1, 1847",She asked if I had tasted these things.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I told her the story of Lusmore the humpback and how it came about that he encountered some fairies and won them over with his beautiful voice and respectful manner.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mrs. Lyons kept the kettle constantly on the boil to make tea.
c02,"May 1, 1847",He is furious with me.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Mrs. Keenan was among those who were to be taken away.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Michael teased that a spirit must have walked over his grave.
c09,"December 1, 1847",I rushed in and saw water all over the floor.
c08,"November 4, 1847","I told her three stories, then said I must get back to work."
c04,"July 3, 1847","As he did, a small metal disc fell to the ground at his feet."
c09,"December 1, 1847","Connor said he had been welcomed and fairly treated when he’d first arrived as an orphan, but soon found himself just one Irish lad among thousands who stood accused of stealing jobs from the people of Montreal and undercutting their wages by agreeing to work for whatever an employer might offer."
c03,"June 1, 1847",He spoke into her ear and kissed her and held her for a moment before she was led away.
c03,"June 1, 1847",But Ma doesn’t seem to hear him.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Connor laughed and said he had never met a baby with such a sharp tongue, but he didn’t seem at all put out."
c09,"December 1, 1847",I looked at Mrs. Hall.
c04,"July 3, 1847","The mother of the beautiful maiden wanted so much for her daughter to marry the prince that
 she lied and told the king that her daughter could spin, weave and sew better than any maiden in the kingdom."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I thought I might find Connor or someone who knew him.
c06,"September 1, 1847","“And does she call you mother?” she said, more sharply than I have ever heard her speak to Mrs. Hall."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Da says we were lucky to be on deck where people could be sick over the side of the vessel.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Many were sick during the storm, and none of the waste could be emptied."
c05,"August 1, 1847","“You are to leave my house this instant,” she said."
c03,"June 1, 1847",Mrs. Keenan is nursing them as best she can.
c02,"May 1, 1847","The wind whipped us the whole way across, and the rain, when it came, drove into my skin like needles of ice."
c08,"November 4, 1847","Disappointed, she started back to the desk to do as she was told."
c05,"August 1, 1847","New children arrive almost daily and are in need of good food and clean clothes, so there is always much to do."
c03,"June 1, 1847","If that cannot happen, then they demand food and fresh water."
c08,"November 4, 1847","We came back with apples in our cheeks and all feeling merry, and Mrs. Lyons had hot tea and bread and butter for us all."
c07,"October 2, 1847",She shows no interest in the doll or the corn-husk horses Lucy and I made for her.
c05,"August 1, 1847",He added that there are some people in the city who would like to ship all the Irish back to their landlords and would do it in a trice if there were a way that would not cost them anything.
c02,"May 1, 1847","The captain told Da that the storm was as bad as any he has ever seen, and it must be a good omen that no one was lost in it."
c03,"June 1, 1847",She refused to eat the porridge I brought her.
c04,"July 3, 1847",All that night we shivered.
c06,"September 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall showed me how to keep them neat and small.
c04,"July 3, 1847","If I ever hear that you again speak to my Peggy as you did today, you will be dismissed immediately.” I was so stunned that I did not know what to say."
c02,"May 1, 1847",What if I fell overboard?
c03,"June 1, 1847",Annie Malone in the berth below us shivers under her shawl despite the sweltering heat in the hold.
c05,"August 1, 1847","“Still, it’s no excuse to take what doesn’t belong to you,” I said."
c07,"October 2, 1847","After I finish my quilt, I want to make a small rug for the floor of my room."
c05,"August 1, 1847","I laid her down and went to tell one of the sisters, who sent me to put out fresh straw that had been delivered to the sheds that afternoon."
c03,"June 1, 1847","He paused before he had gone five paces, and a wail went up."
c04,"July 3, 1847","She says we must not worry, for she is sure of a good response."
c03,"June 1, 1847",At first they seemed astonished to see so much fight in a girl.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I turned to leave when I heard a weak cry for water.
c02,"May 1, 1847","He says we are better off than some, and this is true."
c05,"August 1, 1847",He will send word to Sister Marie-France as soon as he hears anything.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Mrs. Hall said that if I did not want the position, I had only to say so."
c08,"November 4, 1847",I was right.
c05,"August 1, 1847","I am so tired at the end
 of each day."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Finally Mrs. Hall said that she would return in two days and that if I was willing to go with her, the position was mine."
c09,"December 1, 1847",He told me that Michael had left Montreal and gone back to Uncle Liam’s farm.
c03,"June 1, 1847",I asked Michael how Mrs. Keenan was.
c04,"July 3, 1847",The Johanna Leary in the record book had been brought to the shed only two days before Michael’s visit.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Hallow Eve.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Steamer
 is not such a fine word after all."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I am sure many think she is diseased.
c05,"August 1, 1847",She says that she will write to Uncle Liam to tell him where I am as soon as she hears from the postmaster in Bytown.
c06,"September 1, 1847",She hastened to add that she is not one of those people and that she does not blame the immigrants themselves for their plight.
c08,"November 4, 1847","At last Mrs. Lyons tiptoed to the threshold, and a smile appeared on her lips."
c04,"July 3, 1847","We rolled them and took them outside, where we hung
 them on a line."
c07,"October 2, 1847","I have none when I think of my dear ma and wee Patrick, who found their rest in the deep, dark sea."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Fanny said we should try it.
c07,"October 2, 1847",I am stealing a few moments to write before sleep gets the better of me.
c08,"November 4, 1847","I would have hugged her as well, but I was too shy."
c08,"November 4, 1847",She fell easily into the small ruse.
c06,"September 1, 1847","I held my breath to the very end, hoping and praying."
c09,"December 1, 1847",He said he did not want anyone to see him as he was.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Ma stayed in the berth all day with her face to the wall and did not even attend services.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Nor his da.
c05,"August 1, 1847",And what of Michael?
c09,"December 1, 1847","Before he drove away, I asked him to watch for any letter for me at the post office in Sherbrooke."
c05,"August 1, 1847",She only harrumphed and directed me to a new task.
c09,"December 1, 1847","This morning we were all in the kitchen — Mrs. Lyons was making soup, and Lucy was helping me measure flour for some bread — when I heard a distant jingle."
c08,"November 4, 1847","While children enjoy my stories, grown-ups in this country do not seem to approve."
c02,"May 1, 1847",The weather coming across to England was foul.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Da’s da always used to say, “Be careful what you wish for.” I used to think it an odd thing to say."
c05,"August 1, 1847","A policeman came by, grabbed her by the arm and told her that begging was not tolerated on the streets and that if she was in need of something to eat, she should take herself to the sheds, where there was food to be had for the likes of her."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Mr. Hall came in before supper.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mr. Hall was silent the whole day.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Da always said that there is enough wickedness in the world and, for this reason, we should leave evil thoughts to the evil and keep ourselves on the side of the angels."
c03,"June 1, 1847",He shuddered when he said it.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I scrubbed myself in the kitchen under the eyes of Mrs. Coteau, who told me that “Madame” believed very much in cleanliness."
c05,"August 1, 1847","“They are almost more trouble than they are worth,” she said."
c05,"August 1, 1847","The two little ones were Mrs. Hall’s children, Lucy, just five, and Catherine, not yet a year old and plumper than Patrick had ever been."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Instead, I bowed my head and made my way toward him, taking great care to circle around
 behind him so that he would not see me coming."
c03,"June 1, 1847",This is proving difficult to obtain.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Mrs. Fenton and Fanny came over to help core, peel and slice the apples and then hang the pieces on strings to dry."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Then she dismissed me.
c05,"August 1, 1847",That is one good thing about this house.
c04,"July 3, 1847","In the end, it was I who felt punished."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I am making good progress.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Michael says a steamer would likely run out of coal before it got very far and that we are going very far indeed.
c04,"July 3, 1847","She did not look up until she had finished writing, had dusted the powder off her page, and closed her account book."
c02,"May 1, 1847","But because we were among the first to go below, we were able to choose a place close to one of the hatches."
c07,"October 2, 1847",But neither was it the best news.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Finally, I scooped up all the linen in a great armful and thrust it at her, almost bowling her over."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I have thought of nothing but my uncertain future all last night and all of today.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Fanny kept Lucy busy while I gathered my belongings.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I decided that I must be in the shed for the sickest patients for whom there is no hope.
c03,"June 1, 1847",I jabbed him hard with my elbow.
c09,"December 1, 1847","“Does he know about me?” “He knows that you did not perish in the sheds,” Connor said."
c08,"November 4, 1847","Mrs. Lyons and I have been carrying on these past few days, keeping the house clean and snug and amusing Lucy with games and songs."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Sister Marie-France called me back.
c09,"December 1, 1847",I hugged her back and told her she was as close to my own mother as I could ever have hoped to find.
c02,"May 1, 1847",The captain and Da went through the hold and spoke to each family.
c07,"October 2, 1847",By mid-afternoon her worry had so deepened that she sent Mr. Hall again for the doctor.
c01,"April 30, 1847","When we leave, it will bring the day closer when I will be with Anna again and once more hear Da tease us by calling us AnnaJohanna all in one breath, as if we were one person."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Lucy begged me for another.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I went to the sheds again.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Her peel formed an 
S
 or an 
N
, depending on how you looked at it."
c07,"October 2, 1847",This gave me a different picture of Mrs. Fenton.
c06,"September 1, 1847",She also reads novels and books about explorations to distant parts of the world.
c02,"May 1, 1847",He told her to try for a change to imagine the best instead of the worst.
c03,"June 1, 1847","When his body was finally put into the ocean, Mrs. Kelleher rushed to the side of the ship to follow him."
c02,"May 1, 1847","Many are grumbling that the absence of illness is a miracle, so poor is the food that the shipping company has provided."
c08,"November 4, 1847",She held it up so that Mrs. Hall could see it.
c06,"September 1, 1847","While they sat and talked, I amused Lucy and Catherine."
c09,"December 1, 1847",The doctor came again today to see Mr. Hall.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Now that the ship is underway, many people are sick."
c07,"October 2, 1847",She called in on her between each chore all day long.
c04,"July 3, 1847","We were supposed to be at contemplation, but I could not stop thinking of Da, and it is easy enough to steal away without notice."
c09,"December 1, 1847","I was nearly finished when the house came into sight and I saw Mrs. Hall standing in the door, clutching a shawl around her."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Before I could finish this first chore, I was set to work on the vegetables for dinner."
c06,"September 1, 1847",I have been melancholy since morning despite the brightness and business of the day.
c03,"June 1, 1847",I woke in the night to whispering.
c05,"August 1, 1847",She had read my personal thoughts!
c06,"September 1, 1847","Also, I have discovered the secret of maize."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I wish we were still back
 home or at least that we had found a place to stay in England."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Mrs. Coteau especially emphasized that last instruction.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I ache to be where I belong.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Ma is up and about today.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Perhaps he was on his way this very minute to find me.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“Was he wearing this around his neck on a bit of leather tied in four different places?” I asked, for that was how Da always wore his St. Joseph medal, on a bit of ancient leather that he had not been able to
 replace and that had broken several times."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Just then something crashed to the floor.
c02,"May 1, 1847","It has been days since I have written, for no sooner had I left Michael and Connor above deck than Da and Mr. Sullivan came down to announce that a storm was coming."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I was on my way to the sheds farthest from the road, which I had not yet been inside, when someone darted out and collided with me, sending me flying backward."
c02,"May 1, 1847","Ma looked frightened when he mentioned the word 
storm
."
c02,"May 1, 1847","She says she would rather go to England, where she is sure a fine carpenter like Da will find work."
c03,"June 1, 1847","“If I had listened to you,” she says over and over to Da."
c08,"November 4, 1847","She threatened to tell Mrs. Hall what I had done, and said that I would be dismissed."
c08,"November 4, 1847","Sure enough, by mid-morning the sky was thick with fluffy flakes."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I fell to my knees in the muck beside her.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I stood back gratefully to let a lad guide the cart around the snag.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I wonder if Uncle Liam does the same every day — only with sausage instead of oatmeal.
c02,"May 1, 1847",The captain himself came to inspect the hold.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Now I have to wait, and I am not good at that."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I have found the perfect hiding place for my book and my bit of pencil.
c07,"October 2, 1847",I work on my quilt and I learn from Mrs. Hall.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I was blinded by tears and stumbled as he pulled me along like a wagon.
c03,"June 1, 1847",I never noticed how much space Patrick took up in our lives.
c02,"May 1, 1847",The berths to one side of us are taken by the family of the rude girl who nearly trampled me ashore.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Her great-grandparents were French and settled in what was then New France.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Mr. Tattersall said that she is deathly afraid of the sea.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Mr. Tattersall is in a stupor.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Perhaps Mrs. Hall had just been eager to have Lucy back again.
c04,"July 3, 1847","’Twas bad enough he was a thief, but he was also Irish!"
c07,"October 2, 1847",It will keep me warm all winter and I will remember the woods at their prettiest.
c09,"December 1, 1847",She scooped Lucy into her arms and covered her with kisses.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Too queasy to write much.
c05,"August 1, 1847",My head is stuffed with all the things I have learned.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I had to slide my hand beneath him to help raise him up.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I left it to Michael to tell him what we had seen.
c02,"May 1, 1847","I thought she would be angry, but she was not."
c03,"June 1, 1847","The doctor looked long and hard at Connor, his head covered as usual with his shawl."
c08,"November 4, 1847","I was sure that when next she spoke, thunder would echo out of her mouth and lightning bolts would flash from her eyes."
c08,"November 4, 1847","So I began a
 story about the leprechauns and their pots of gold."
c05,"August 1, 1847","“So you justify your own thievery by accusing everyone of being a thief,” I said."
c02,"May 1, 1847",He remained in his berth all day.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Michael argued that if the Kellehers had stayed home, they would likely be dead from starvation by now."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Her face was as black as the sky when a storm strikes.
c03,"June 1, 1847",I tried my best to stay awake but dozed off.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Nearing came back to get her he told us more about what had happened.
c03,"June 1, 1847","We have reached Quebec City, which is on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River, and the captain has ordered a general cleanup."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Here is something I did not know about her.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Mrs. Lyons told me that Mrs. Hall lost her last baby, a little boy, to fever."
c02,"May 1, 1847","Michael says it serves
 me right for being prideful about not getting ill in the first place."
c04,"July 3, 1847","What a long and horrible day it was, and what a fine and generous person Sister Marie-France is."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Almost as soon as I arrived, I saw the thief who had knocked me down yesterday."
c04,"July 3, 1847",She looked up at me through thick brown lashes and nodded solemnly.
c04,"July 3, 1847","When Connor turned to leave, his eyes lit upon me and a whiteness came over him."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Everywhere I go, I hear someone speak of the Irish as lazy and the makers of their own misfortune."
c03,"June 1, 1847",One was a single man who had no one to protest his going.
c09,"December 1, 1847",I am almost at the end of the book I brought from home.
c04,"July 3, 1847",There are so many things to be cleaned in this house.
c04,"July 3, 1847",He had often boasted that she was the prettiest girl he had ever met and how clever he had been to steal her heart.
c04,"July 3, 1847",A dipper hung from its side.
c03,"June 1, 1847","I whispered a prayer and turned away, but I think the sight will haunt me."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I did not know what to say to her.
c08,"November 4, 1847",By midday the snow was up to the middle of my calf and was falling more thickly than ever.
c03,"June 1, 1847",I don’t think I could bear it if anything happened to her or if we had to leave her in the sea.
c03,"June 1, 1847","The captain says it is because there are so many ships and so many ill. As well, the people who live in Quebec want little to do with those of us on ships."
c09,"December 1, 1847",How would he manage all that had to be done about the place with one arm?
c03,"June 1, 1847","I couldn’t see what had happened, but Michael soon had it whispered to him from Connor, who was ahead of him."
c09,"December 1, 1847",They were solemn-faced when they came into the house.
c08,"November 4, 1847",He bundled us all up under a great bearskin to keep us warm and we flew off across the snow.
c04,"July 3, 1847",He is a banker.
c04,"July 3, 1847","She did not address me but spoke only to Mrs. Coteau, directing that I be washed thoroughly, for she did not trust the sisters to have done the job properly."
c04,"July 3, 1847","To my astonishment, he rushed to me, took both my hands in his and held them tightly."
c05,"August 1, 1847","But I detest Mrs. Johnson and, as I left, wished her an eternity in the bad place, and for this I am ashamed."
c02,"May 1, 1847",There is nothing around us but water.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Da looks pale but says he is fine.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Lyons said that this was because it was going to snow.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Perhaps Anna got to share with her two sisters and they giggled their way across the ocean.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Most of it slopped onto the floor, which we scrubbed now as best as our arms and backs would allow."
c04,"July 3, 1847","From the matter caked inside them, I guessed that they had been left where they were for a day or two."
c05,"August 1, 1847","This morning when I took Mrs. Coteau her tea, my third chore of the day after stoking the fire in the stove and boiling the kettle, I asked if she had seen anything of mine lying about."
c05,"August 1, 1847",The door to the library was closed.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Fanny appeared a moment later, and I braced myself for some new criticism."
c04,"July 3, 1847","She gave me the information and directions besides, and I made my way to the address, which was located down in a dank alley near the water."
c06,"September 1, 1847",She says girls try to peel an apple in one long strip and then throw the peel over their shoulders.
c02,"May 1, 1847","The hatch had been opened, and a shaft of moonlight falling into the foul hold illuminated a standing figure."
c09,"December 1, 1847",His name is Tommy Ryan.” I stared at Connor.
c09,"December 1, 1847",My heart seemed to stop in my chest and I feared the worst.
c05,"August 1, 1847","When winter comes, Mrs. Hall says I am to have a quilt to keep me warm."
c08,"November 4, 1847","“You were stealing, and don’t deny it,” Mrs. Fenton said."
c06,"September 1, 1847",She likes poetry best and has learned many poems by heart.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I rushed, linens and all, to find Connor all wide-eyed and wild-haired, shouting, if you please, at Sister Marie-France."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Fenton stared at the golden chain and fob in my hands and then at the open desk drawer.
c07,"October 2, 1847","While it is true that she had to show me what to do, she did not have to stand over me while I worked."
c04,"July 3, 1847",No sooner had we set foot on land than Da collapsed.
c08,"November 4, 1847","Without stopping to protect herself against the cold, she ran out into the yard."
c06,"September 1, 1847","On her last trip to Montreal, the one when she engaged me, she paid a visit to a woman who is known to her family in England."
c05,"August 1, 1847",My hand trembled as I rapped at her door.
c05,"August 1, 1847","He laughed and said that no constable would help me as he was doing, unless there was a profit to be made from foul and diseased straw, in which case, I would be relieved of both my load and my cart, and that would be the last I saw of either."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Most of the passengers know by now that he is a boy.
c05,"August 1, 1847",My heart raced as I made my way to her door.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I don’t know for certain what was in his mind, but his stillness made he think that he was remembering Ma the way she was when times were good, or perhaps when they had first courted."
c02,"May 1, 1847",I didn’t burn the oatmeal.
c05,"August 1, 1847",How I wish things had never changed.
c04,"July 3, 1847",How I miss my own da and how he used to laugh and tumble with Michael and me and sing to wee Patrick.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I went back and forth to the barrel of water to help as many as I could.
c03,"June 1, 1847","We have come far, and the journey has been hard."
c09,"December 1, 1847","When I went in to clean it up, he shouted at me to go away."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I have asked many times for permission to visit the hospital sheds, but Sister Marie-France denies me."
c09,"December 1, 1847","The morning was bright and sunny, and Lucy was restless in the house."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mr. Hall improves a little every day.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Only a few of the sisters speak English.
c07,"October 2, 1847","While I was sweeping the whole house with my cedar broom, I came upon Mrs. Fenton in the parlour."
c04,"July 3, 1847","A woman, her sleeves pushed up and a cap upon her head, set aside her rolling pin and came around the table to look more closely at me."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I am ashamed to say that I could not tell whether the person crying out was a man or a woman, so dirty was the face, so matted the hair, and so wasted the figure."
c02,"May 1, 1847","He said that his ma was so afraid he would be arrested and hanged that she dressed him as a girl and claimed he was her daughter, but that no matter how hard he tried, he could never master a girl’s ways."
c03,"June 1, 1847",The weather seems to have caught the mood of the ship.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Sister Marie-France quickly said that I was grateful for the offer and would be ready to do whatever was required.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Uncle Liam was well too.
c04,"July 3, 1847",And all must be scrubbed or swept or polished until they sparkle.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Michael says that he heard the captain tell one of the mates that the newspapers are filled with editorials about the Irish lords shovelling their garbage into Canada.
c09,"December 1, 1847",She stayed for a long time.
c02,"May 1, 1847","The captain read a passage from the Scriptures, and Mr. Tattersall was laid to his rest in the ocean while Mrs. Tattersall wept."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I am ashamed and glad both at the same time.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Ma tends to him constantly, cooling his brow with water and trying to get him to drink a little."
c03,"June 1, 1847",I didn’t find out until hours later what had happened.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Almost without exception, the women’s hearts seem to soften as they bend down to look into blue eyes or brown eyes so close to the ground."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I ache for my family — what little is left of it.
c02,"May 1, 1847",The captain came and dosed Mr. Tattersall with a purgative.
c06,"September 1, 1847",It was not properly prepared.
c02,"May 1, 1847",He said the captain would shut the hatches to keep the water from coming in.
c02,"May 1, 1847","“Excuse me, I’m sure,” I said in a loud voice, but she did not take the hint."
c09,"December 1, 1847","She will also be able to rely on her own family for help, not only with Mr. Hall but with Lucy and the new baby as well."
c02,"May 1, 1847",All the women and the children who are able have been cleaning below.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Mr. Kelleher finally grasped her around the waist and clung tightly to her.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Mrs. Hall said that she thought she could spare me for an hour,
 and we went walking in the woods together."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I had not been an orphan when I first set foot in this house, but I entered now as one."
c04,"July 3, 1847",It felt cold to my fingertips.
c04,"July 3, 1847","A brother from one of the orders tried to shoo them off, but
 they persisted."
c05,"August 1, 1847","“You are ungrateful and ignorant.” She opened my book, grasping one half in each hand, and made ready to tear it in half."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall said that she would pay and then deduct the amount from my wages.
c08,"November 4, 1847","It
 snowed all day."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Will he be able to find Uncle Liam?
c02,"May 1, 1847",Each has five or six people in it.
c09,"December 1, 1847",But this news of Sister Marie-France was like black clouds.
c02,"May 1, 1847",She asked me what I was doing with it.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Has Uncle Liam given up on us?
c03,"June 1, 1847",Another was a child whose mother was determined to go with him.
c09,"December 1, 1847","“I was in the square near the house owned by the nuns,” he said."
c08,"November 4, 1847",They wafted down slowly and landed as lightly as if they were feathers.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I hurried to catch up with them and was astonished to find out that although they appeared to be going to the same place I was, they were not Irish."
c08,"November 4, 1847","But her look of expectation turned to a frown and I heard her say, “It’s Frederick Nearing."
c07,"October 2, 1847","She is as quiet as a wee mouse inside the house and speaks only when she accompanies me outside to replenish the kindling, to gather cedar boughs for a new broom, or on some other small errand."
c04,"July 3, 1847",He was about to call for help to restrain Connor.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Some days I think that all I do is wish.
c05,"August 1, 1847",No news of Michael.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Two sailors rushed to his
 aid, but even so the three of them had a struggle on their hands to stop her from plunging into the deep."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I tried to get it down before, but I wasn’t able to."
c05,"August 1, 1847","I heard one gentleman tell another that there are more than fifteen hundred men, women and children in the sheds, and that some twenty or more die every day and must be disposed of."
c05,"August 1, 1847",What if he cannot?
c06,"September 1, 1847","As payment, the woman kept part of the soap to sell."
c09,"December 1, 1847","And, of course, my book, with almost all of its pages filled now with so many sad things and so many new things."
c06,"September 1, 1847","I know it is probably a sin to say so, but I do not like Mrs. Fenton one bit."
c05,"August 1, 1847",A person in my station could not afford to act as I had.
c02,"May 1, 1847","We walked all day yesterday and the day before and have eaten most of the little
 store of food we brought with us."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I mean to work hard for her and to be especially careful not to drop anything.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Hall is at the window as often as Lucy.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I was very nearly upon him when he bent down and lifted what appeared to be a bundle of rags.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Why else would she be standing there in the cold?
c04,"July 3, 1847","The spelling is a little different from my own name, but Michael likely took this as a mistake if indeed he saw it written out."
c02,"May 1, 1847","Nor could I dispute what he said, though the heartlessness of the landlords does not excuse the sin of robbery."
c05,"August 1, 1847","The voice was a man’s, and I would not have paid attention had he not mentioned “the Irish.” It was pitiable, he said, how they were heard to be starving in ditches."
c04,"July 3, 1847",She listened to my tale and then had another sister take me to the kitchen to make sure that I ate.
c09,"December 1, 1847",And I have my shawl.
c01,"April 30, 1847",I know I will find her.
c07,"October 2, 1847",I got lost!
c09,"December 1, 1847",I amused Lucy as best I could while Mrs. Hall sat in a chair by the window.
c05,"August 1, 1847",At the back of the house beside the drawing room is Mr. and Mrs. Hall’s bedroom.
c02,"May 1, 1847",His name is Connor and he is wanted by the authorities.
c05,"August 1, 1847","The straw upon which she lay was damp and putrid, but there was nothing to be done about that."
c04,"July 3, 1847",He gave me a sharp look but pointed out the direction I should take.
c05,"August 1, 1847",She gave me an odd look.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I help the little ones out of their rags and into a bath and fresh clothes.
c04,"July 3, 1847",There are many people here who speak French.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Was she going to ask me to go with her?
c06,"September 1, 1847",I am too weary to write.
c06,"September 1, 1847","When I returned to the house, Mrs. Hall and Mrs. Lyons had the bread in the bake oven, soup stock on the stove, and had started to prepare the meat for the workmen’s dinner — and were keeping an eye on baby Catherine, who slept in a basket in the corner."
c05,"August 1, 1847","A veranda runs across the front of the house, and there is a kitchen garden at the rear where Mrs. Hall grows vegetables."
c09,"December 1, 1847","He always kept himself busy, working to improve his farm."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Fanny is my first true friend in Canada.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I knocked and Mrs. Johnson bade me enter.
c08,"November 4, 1847","“It’s Duncan Webley under there,” he said gently."
c04,"July 3, 1847","“I’ll come and get you,” Connor promised his brother."
c04,"July 3, 1847","He did not know what had made him go so quickly, only that he was on his way to the Gatineau Hills, near Bytown."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mr. Hall is due back any day.
c03,"June 1, 1847","He said it would have been better if Thomas had died at home where he could be buried in the ground with a priest to say words over him, instead of being tossed into the ocean like so much refuse."
c06,"September 1, 1847","So am I, for seeing the wee thing so ill reminds me of Patrick, and that reminds me how much I miss Ma and Da and Michael."
c03,"June 1, 1847",It was only the quick action of the first mate that saved her.
c04,"July 3, 1847",It was only by chance that I happened to find out.
c08,"November 4, 1847",I shook my head.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I crept close and listened.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“I know this story,” Peggy declared."
c05,"August 1, 1847","It was an admirable plan, for when Mrs. Coteau examined my work at the end of the day, she did not scold me."
c04,"July 3, 1847","In my haste, I collided with a nun who appeared as if from nowhere, carrying a huge pile of fresh linen."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Mr. Tattersall was up and about this morning and came to services on deck.
c02,"May 1, 1847","She did not press the matter, but I could not stop wondering what the captain had said to him."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Ma always said that you can no more judge a person at first glance than you can a pudding before you taste it, for people are often not what they seem."
c07,"October 2, 1847","I know she misses her baby sister, but I think she is more worried about her parents who are here and are so sad, than she is about her sister, who she knows is an angel in heaven."
c04,"July 3, 1847","When I turned I could scarcely believe my eyes, for there was Michael,
 clean-scrubbed and jumping down from a wagon driven by an older man."
c02,"May 1, 1847","They are seven and have no babies like Patrick, who takes up little space."
c02,"May 1, 1847","But I was not in a mood to argue about what was right and what was wrong, especially when the two of them would have countered every word."
c03,"June 1, 1847",The sombre look in my face told me that she had passed.
c05,"August 1, 1847",There was a long silence.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I ran for the stairs.
c02,"May 1, 1847","(It is a
 poor thing, dented in one side."
c04,"July 3, 1847",There are cloths and aprons and towels.
c05,"August 1, 1847",She says it gets very cold in this part of the country and that it may come as a shock to me.
c04,"July 3, 1847",He interrupted the fairies when they sang their fairy songs and he was disrespectful enough to demand that they remove his hump as they had removed Lusmore’s.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I reflected a great deal on this and on what I saw when I went there looking for Da.
c06,"September 1, 1847",Where is Michael?
c05,"August 1, 1847","The same gentleman said that he will be glad when the new sheds are completed at Windmill Point and the sick are moved there, so that the plague which is carrying off so many of the city’s “valuable citizens” may be checked and public confidence restored."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I caught sight of Mr. William Johnson for the first time.
c01,"April 30, 1847","For myself, I think of Anna
 going out there last year with her family."
c08,"November 4, 1847","The sky was as grey as stone yesterday morning, but the air was not as cold as it has been."
c03,"June 1, 1847",There is no one else to look after Kerry and Daniel.
c03,"June 1, 1847",He tells Ma that no one could have foretold how bad things would become.
c06,"September 1, 1847",She spoke as if I were working for her instead of Mrs. Hall.
c08,"November 4, 1847","Last night while Mrs. Lyons was working on some clothes for the expected babe of a niece in
 Montreal and Mrs. Lyons and I were knitting socks — she for Mr. Hall and I finishing a pair for Fanny — Lucy asked me to tell a fairy story."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Some will be kept in a barrel in the root cellar.
c08,"November 4, 1847","Mrs. Hall has gone to Sherbrooke, leaving Lucy in the care of Mrs. Lyons and me."
c05,"August 1, 1847","In some places the road consisted of logs laid side by side, making it far too spine-jarring to ride."
c08,"November 4, 1847",But where is —” She stopped before she finished her question.
c09,"December 1, 1847","Connor stayed to find work, which was not easy."
c03,"June 1, 1847","I have gone through every tale, riddle and song that I know and all the games that may be played in a small space."
c04,"July 3, 1847",He hugged me close for a moment and then held me at arm’s length and laughed as he said he could not remember when he had seen me so well-dressed.
c05,"August 1, 1847",One of the wheels had caught on a cobble that had worked its way up above the others.
c08,"November 4, 1847","Just one more, she said, and she would be satisfied."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Her eyes stared up at the plank ceiling.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Tears filled my eyes as I walked up one row, peering into hollowed eyes and waxen faces, praying that I would find no one I knew."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Sister Marie-France must have told Mrs. Hall about how and why Mrs. Johnson had dismissed me.
c08,"November 4, 1847","“Johanna took it and broke it,” Mrs. Fenton said."
c07,"October 2, 1847","Little Catherine lies in a coffin, which is lined with her own quilt, covered all over with roses and lilacs."
c09,"December 1, 1847","He looked uncomfortably at Mrs. Fenton, who told Fanny to take Lucy into the kitchen to see if there was any cake."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I asked her if she would like to hear a fairy story while I worked.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Mrs. Johnson stared at me, her eyes black with fury."
c01,"April 30, 1847","Even in spite of this, Ma is sad to leave."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Mr. Tattersall has died.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Her grandmother caused a scandal by wedding an Englishman and raising her children in the English language.
c03,"June 1, 1847",The biscuit has so much horse bran in it that it is hard to digest and is making people ill.
c02,"May 1, 1847","“They are searching for stowaways,” Michael whispered."
c05,"August 1, 1847","On my last morning in Montreal I packed my meagre belongings — my little book; a fresh stub of pencil that had been given to me by the sisters; an old apron and a worn coat, also gifts from the
 sisters — all caught up in a bundle and tied with strips of rag, and stood waiting at the gate early in the morning."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Ma insisted on a topmost berth.
c07,"October 2, 1847",She says there is little besides that and indoor work that can be done during the winter months in this country.
c04,"July 3, 1847","In the middle, more rough beds had been scattered and, between them, heaps of straw on the floor, with people lying atop them."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Not only had she taken my book, she had 
read
 it."
c06,"September 1, 1847","Mrs. Hall laughed, but in a nice way, and said she used to have the same trouble whenever she worked with a new pair of knitting needles."
c02,"May 1, 1847","Our new home, as Da calls it, consists of one berth, which is only a grand name for a bit of plank, like a shelf, set into the side of the ship."
c06,"September 1, 1847","I fall into my bed each night, so tired I cannot keep my eyes open."
c09,"December 1, 1847","“Let it be me,” I pleaded."
c07,"October 2, 1847","“You have a home here for as long as you care to
 stay,” Mrs. Hall said."
c06,"September 1, 1847",She promised to come and visit again as soon as she could get away.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Pierre drove to the back and pointed to the door where I should enter.
c04,"July 3, 1847","That woman gave her daughter the following lesson: Unless you are beautiful like the maiden and have three fairy aunts, you cannot hope to be saved from hard work and how it wears on the body."
c08,"November 4, 1847",We saw tracks in the snow — Mr. Fenton says they are deer.
c04,"July 3, 1847",One of the sisters noticed my absence and reported it to Sister Marie-France.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Neighbours came all day to pay their respects.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Michael slipped into the Keenan berth, saying that he was going to keep an eye on Kerry."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Da says this makes us among the fortunate.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Almost instantly her mother called for her to come away.
c09,"December 1, 1847",We had a jolly time making tracks in the snow and sliding on the ice of a pond.
c08,"November 4, 1847","The very next day, she learns that he is no rude peasant but is the master of a vast domain and that all the people who came to him with their problems are his subjects, who adore him."
c07,"October 2, 1847",At least she has that comfort.
c04,"July 3, 1847","After that
 there was more washing up to do as well as finishing the pots."
c04,"July 3, 1847",But still he could not say whether I was on the mark or not.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Because there are so many ships waiting in the river, we will be allowed to leave a few days early and will be transported to Montreal."
c06,"September 1, 1847","In addition to the cooking, I have been helping with the little girls, especially Lucy, who is always eager to play chase-about."
c03,"June 1, 1847",The doctor signalled her to step aside.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Immediately behind was Mrs. Hall with two young girls.
c09,"December 1, 1847",How would he be able to do that with one arm?
c05,"August 1, 1847",I looked down at the floor and mumbled that I was happy to be offered a position.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Here is what happened.
c02,"May 1, 1847","In the hold, they had to use buckets or the floor."
c02,"May 1, 1847",It makes me think of the little cloud of steam that rises when you break open a potato hot from the fire.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mrs. Hall was anxious about her candles.
c04,"July 3, 1847",She so startled me that I dropped the potato I was peeling and splashed water on the hem of her frock.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Her voice was gentler now, and she told me she had something else to tell me."
c07,"October 2, 1847","Indeed, she could not, as she and Mrs. Lyons salted over 100 pounds of meat."
c04,"July 3, 1847",“Is it true you believe in fairies?” she asked at last.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I had to let Michael know that I was alive.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Mother Superior insists that the babies be clean at all times so as to
 reassure those who are charitable enough to take them that they are not ill and carry no infection."
c05,"August 1, 1847","There was a woman with her, a Mrs. Hall."
c04,"July 3, 1847","The sister in charge of the house, Sister Marie-France, told us that the archbishop has called on parishioners to open their homes and their hearts to Irish orphans."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Who would save us?
c09,"December 1, 1847",Tears of joy ran down my cheeks.
c04,"July 3, 1847",He dresses elegantly and leaves the house early each morning to go to his office.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Connor was soaking wet.
c03,"June 1, 1847",What if she had fallen ill?
c03,"June 1, 1847",No one is happy.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Poor perhaps.
c04,"July 3, 1847","As I scrambled to my feet, the bundle, which was an old blanket, spilled out ragged clothing, a few bits of ancient cookware, a Bible, a purse … An odd collection of items, I thought."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Some of them cook.
c03,"June 1, 1847",“I do not think you should tell Da.” “How does Connor —?” I began before remembering him dripping on the floor of the hold.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“So the lesson in the story is that if you lie about what you can do, you will be rewarded."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I slowed as I approached the first rough building, which was ringed with tents."
c03,"June 1, 1847",We must stay on board for six more days so that the authorities can be sure that no one else falls ill. Rumours are flying from passenger to passenger.
c02,"May 1, 1847","He lies motionless in his berth, barely drawing breath and mewling like an infant."
c05,"August 1, 1847","The next day Mr. Fenton left Mrs. Hall, the children and me at the Halls’ house."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Da tells us not to listen.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“Thieving from your own people.” “I only take from those who have no more use for earthly things,” he said defiantly."
c05,"August 1, 1847","I had said my goodbyes to those who mattered, not a soul among them kin to me."
c02,"May 1, 1847","After services on the deck this morning, I discovered Michael’s secret."
c07,"October 2, 1847",She was much satisfied with Mrs. Lyons but not at all satisfied with me.
c05,"August 1, 1847",She loved her few books almost above all else.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mr. Hall raced forward to try to push him aside.
c02,"May 1, 1847",The fireplace wasn’t as hard to cook on as I feared.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I could do nothing but stare at my book.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I passed the evening with two other girls who were put out to service but had been sent back by their mistresses.
c09,"December 1, 1847",It wasn’t right that Mrs. Lyons should go and I should stay.
c02,"May 1, 1847","After a long time of being tossed about and shrieked at by the wind, I heard a crash, like a shelf full of crockery smashing onto a flagstone floor."
c09,"December 1, 1847","Mrs. Hall says that he does not feel up to visitors, although Lucy was allowed to sit with him for a few minutes."
c07,"October 2, 1847","She says Mrs. Fenton adores the little Hall girls, especially since Fanny had a brother and a sister who died before Fanny was born."
c08,"November 4, 1847",It is nearly one month since Mr. Hall went away to the logging camp.
c09,"December 1, 1847",I have more than I had when I arrived only a few months ago.
c05,"August 1, 1847","“What’s your brother’s name?” When I told him, he said that if he ever saw Michael, he would tell him to look for me with the Hall family outside of Sherbrooke."
c01,"April 30, 1847","He says that Canada is a big country and that, anyway, many Irish leave Canada to go to America, which is bigger than Ireland."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Then, embarrassed, I pulled away from her."
c04,"July 3, 1847",“And you’re sure he was dead?” I asked.
c03,"June 1, 1847","We gather them above deck where the air is fresh and good, and do our best to amuse them so that their mothers can tend to their chores and, increasingly, their patients."
c03,"June 1, 1847","Everyone is in poor spirits, especially as news has come back to us that three children, two women and two men from the ship have died in hospital."
c04,"July 3, 1847",There was so little room that anyone who sat was in great danger of being trampled — not that I cared.
c08,"November 4, 1847",I touched the spot where Mrs. Fenton had struck me — it was on fire — and told Mrs. Fenton that it was not her place to dismiss me.
c02,"May 1, 1847",They are sailing ships.
c09,"December 1, 1847","Mr. Hall had tried to pour himself some water from a pitcher on a small table beside his bed, but his left arm — his only arm — is weak and he dropped the pitcher."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Now I wish that I had found my tongue and told her
 exactly what I thought of her Peggy."
c06,"September 1, 1847",I could have wept with joy.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Or did his faith give him strength?
c04,"July 3, 1847","“Michael.” I was sure he must be joking, and said I saw no humour in the jest."
c07,"October 2, 1847",He sat with her and fed her the way one might feed a child.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Hall thanked her for telling the truth and said that she must not touch Papa’s things again.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Nestled in it were a beautifully carved brush and a comb of bone.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Fenton has strong opinions, but she is a good woman."
c04,"July 3, 1847","When at last we arrived at our destination, we
 pressed forward to get off the ship."
c03,"June 1, 1847","So soft and fluffy they were, and so delicious with a little milk and a pinch of salt — my heart aches for home when times were good."
c04,"July 3, 1847","She shook her head but, to my mind, seemed to have doubts on the matter."
c04,"July 3, 1847","She is a thin, stern-looking woman."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Michael is found!
c03,"June 1, 1847",The ship is moving so slowly that a man ashore could surely make faster progress.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Ma worries all the time.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Just thinking about sizzling sausage makes my mouth water, even though I have never eaten it."
c08,"November 4, 1847","I was careful to be quiet, telling Lucy that it is the custom to tell these stories in a low voice so that the fairies would not overhear them and become angry."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I will ask Sister Marie-France who has taken Daniel, so that Connor can get him back."
c09,"December 1, 1847",We all three rushed to see who it was.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Connor and Michael and I seem to have become the keepers of the children.
c04,"July 3, 1847",There are carpets.
c09,"December 1, 1847","I didn’t want to alarm Lucy, so I proposed a race."
c09,"December 1, 1847",The Halls have rented some rooms in a house in town.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Da returned, his face sombre as a judge’s, but he forced a smile when Ma asked him if anything was amiss."
c02,"May 1, 1847",I saw him creep to the farthest end of the hold and tuck himself behind a pile of trunks and boxes secured with rope.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall is pale and her face lined with worry.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I’m leaving for there tomorrow.” We reached our destination at the water’s edge.
c09,"December 1, 1847","Connor said he immediately found someone who could write a letter
 for him to Michael."
c04,"July 3, 1847","She is Mrs. Coteau, the Johnsons’ cook."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I imagined that she was thinking of how sweet the butter would taste.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mrs. Lyons left today.
c07,"October 2, 1847",This time I could not hold back my tears.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I waited all day for Michael to visit and at the same time dreaded having to tell him what I had discovered.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Why did bad always follow good?
c03,"June 1, 1847","In the end, Da did what he could to assure her that they would be cared for."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I said that perhaps God had protected me because he meant for me to help the less fortunate of my countrymen.
c02,"May 1, 1847","I cannot be sure, but I think he was giving thanks."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I did not tell her where I had gone.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Instead, I looked at Connor."
c09,"December 1, 1847",It was all I could do to not stare at it and to keep the pity from my eyes.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Kerry Keenan has been taken ashore to the hospital.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Over and over again she mumbles to herself, “If only … if only.” Da had to coax Patrick from her arms."
c08,"November 4, 1847","I was well into one about a leprechaun when, of a sudden, the very blood in my veins turned to ice and I stopped the tale, for didn’t I hear the wail of the banshee?"
c06,"September 1, 1847","Not only was it unending work to keep them fed, but it was a great expense."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Connor, dressed now in boys’ clothes, was grateful for what the captain had done, and thanked him before he left the ship."
c04,"July 3, 1847",“An old woman will do it for her and then the maiden must either guess the old woman’s name or surrender her first-born child.” So smug did she sound that I was pleased indeed to tell her that she was wrong.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Half the people I approached had no English, and the other half knew nothing."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Sister Marie-France sent for me at mid-morning.
c05,"August 1, 1847","He was silent, then after a moment he said that
 leaving home did not turn out to be the salvation his ma dreamed of."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Everyone is quiet.
c09,"December 1, 1847","He stood when he saw me and looked me over and laughed, declaring that he would not have
 recognized me in such a fine dress and with meat on my bones for a change."
c03,"June 1, 1847",He pointed to something in the distance.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I wish Connor would return so that I would have someone I know to talk to.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Across from the drawing room is a dining room, and behind that another bedroom where Mrs. Hall’s two little girls sleep."
c09,"December 1, 1847",“But I cannot.
c05,"August 1, 1847","When I told him, he pushed on."
c07,"October 2, 1847","It was not one of the gay tunes she used to sing, swirling around the room with one or other of her girls in her arms, but was slow and sombre like a hymn."
c04,"July 3, 1847",“Whoever told you that?” I asked.
c02,"May 1, 1847","One by one her precious little store of books left her by her own da, my dear grandda, vanished — all save this little one that I am writing in."
c08,"November 4, 1847",I hoped it would bring a fresh smile to Mrs. Hall’s face.
c06,"September 1, 1847",She collects them from the ends of clothes that she makes or remakes.
c02,"May 1, 1847",He lay awake all night with aches in his arms and legs.
c09,"December 1, 1847",A few tears slipped down my cheek when I said I would miss her too.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I cannot say what came over me, but while everyone else was distracted by Connor, I fled to the hospital myself."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Lyons has returned.
c04,"July 3, 1847",She has a head full of golden curls and the little pink lips of a cherub.
c07,"October 2, 1847","You cut strips of fabric and then stitch the shorts ends together to make long, colourful snakes."
c09,"December 1, 1847",But Connor was lucky.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Someone will come to collect me.
c03,"June 1, 1847","He says she loves Michael and me both, but that she has weathered the passing of four babes now and that she loved each one of them too."
c07,"October 2, 1847",She says she will help me as soon as she has finished the one she is working on.
c05,"August 1, 1847","The roof, like all roofs in this country, is very steep because of the snow."
c03,"June 1, 1847","For two long days and nights, the wind howled and the ocean tossed our ship as if it were no more than a twig on the waters."
c09,"December 1, 1847",The Fentons had come to visit.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Several of the men went to the captain and angrily demanded to know if the government of Quebec planned to keep us anchored in the St. Lawrence River until we all die of either ship’s fever or starvation and thirst.
c02,"May 1, 1847","He eats beef and
 pork."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall is greatly relieved.
c09,"December 1, 1847","Mrs. Hall not only needed me with her, but she also wanted me to stay, and Mrs. Lyons was glad for that."
c09,"December 1, 1847",I have not seen Mr. Hall yet.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Everything had to be in perfect order.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I have heard that people are afraid to hire those from the ships for fear of contagion.
c05,"August 1, 1847",She also gathers berries when they are in season and makes jam out of them.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Why couldn’t everyone live happily ever after?
c05,"August 1, 1847","She is better now that she is back with the sisters, but not strong enough to work yet."
c04,"July 3, 1847","When I finished with the wash, I went and asked Sister Marie-France about employment."
c06,"September 1, 1847","I wish Ma and Da were with me and that we had our own cosy house with a cow in the barn, and chickens, just like the Halls."
c03,"June 1, 1847","Da says it is most likely a tooth coming in, but Ma refuses to believe this."
c03,"June 1, 1847","When next I opened my eyes, Michael was lifting Daniel down into Connor’s arms."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Neither of them noted my presence.
c04,"July 3, 1847",The people of Montreal can see with their own eyes how many orphans are in need of a home and a good Catholic upbringing.
c05,"August 1, 1847",She called me “an ignorant thing who had never seen a cookstove before I charitably took her in and whose eyes grow as large as dinner plates at the merest mention of food.” She thought me ignorant?
c04,"July 3, 1847",I was about to deliver him a lecture that would have made Ma proud when the meaning of his words struck me like a slap.
c03,"June 1, 1847",He grabbed at her skirts and let out a shout.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I remember when she used to say this fondly.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“And they punished her.” “She did invite them,” I said, pleased yet again to correct her."
c08,"November 4, 1847",So did Lucy.
c05,"August 1, 1847","I was sent to put out plates of buttered bread, cake and a large bowl of trifle that Mrs. Coteau had made and that smelled so delicious that my mouth fairly watered."
c05,"August 1, 1847","But Sister Marie-France has already thought of
 that."
c02,"May 1, 1847","Over the wailing of passengers and the wind, I heard Da call for help."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I can hardly believe it.
c09,"December 1, 1847","Besides, she added, I was alone in the world, and that wasn’t right."
c06,"September 1, 1847",I have been too busy helping her to write more than just this little bit.
c03,"June 1, 1847","“We can’t leave without Ma.” “Da will talk to the captain,” Michael said."
c06,"September 1, 1847",But instead she helped me with my work and asked me if it was true that I had come to Canada because of the famine in Ireland.
c06,"September 1, 1847",A man I do not know came by yesterday and gave Mrs. Hall some letters and parcels from the post office in Sherbrooke.
c07,"October 2, 1847",I think she is remembering small moments with Catherine.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Now the trees are bare and their branches reach up like the scrawny fingers of beggars pleading for a mouthful to eat or a penny to buy food.
c06,"September 1, 1847","I said yes, although I am not very good at it."
c09,"December 1, 1847",But he isn’t in Montreal.
c02,"May 1, 1847","His face was pale, but he whistled a fine tune for his babies while Mrs. Tattersall was above deck making stirabout."
c04,"July 3, 1847","The man on the wagon called for Michael, and Michael said he must go."
c05,"August 1, 1847",“And this is how you repay me!
c05,"August 1, 1847",Mrs. Johnson is the ignorant one for believing such lies!
c05,"August 1, 1847",Claire then put on her cleanest uniform and prepared to answer the door.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Sad news.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Poor Connor.
c03,"June 1, 1847",There was a lighthouse on it.
c04,"July 3, 1847",But I saw a barrel and made for it.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I do not think I believe him.
c09,"December 1, 1847","I could
 never leave Michael."
c05,"August 1, 1847","“You had nothing when you came here but the clothes on your back, and those only out of charity.” She told me to get to my chores."
c02,"May 1, 1847",But Da refuses to worry.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Michael counted fifty-two berths altogether, in two rows."
c04,"July 3, 1847","By the time I reached it, he was a small thing at the end of the street and about to vanish again."
c03,"June 1, 1847","Mrs. Kelleher wailed that the storm was brought on by the restless dead, lashing out in anger because they were not laid to rest in consecrated ground."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I help Mrs. Hall prepare the afternoon meal.
c04,"July 3, 1847","She said that much of my time would be spent in the kitchen, but that I would be expected to help with the general cleaning when needed."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Perhaps he has even married and has a baby to attend to.
c03,"June 1, 1847","A terror went through me for it had no shroud, and I thought of all those we had buried at sea."
c04,"July 3, 1847",He slipped both inside his shirt and straightened.
c04,"July 3, 1847","When I asked if he had had word of Kerry, he grew so sad that I felt sure the little lad must have passed."
c03,"June 1, 1847",So is Connor’s sister Colleen.
c06,"September 1, 1847",She did not seem at all annoyed or angry.
c02,"May 1, 1847",He says it’s a secret.
c09,"December 1, 1847","I hugged her, and she hugged me back."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Her face was lined with worry.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Tears sprang to his eyes when he heard Michael’s news, and his fingers went to the St. Joseph
 medal around his neck as he mouthed a prayer for Ma."
c02,"May 1, 1847","When the captain left, Da looked troubled."
c07,"October 2, 1847","She even smiles from time to time, but not with the same brightness as before."
c02,"May 1, 1847",There was no way of knowing the true passage of time for we could not see the sun or the moon or the stars.
c07,"October 2, 1847",It will look so beautiful on my little bed.
c08,"November 4, 1847","When I arose this morning and went down to the kitchen to stir up the fire, I could not see out the kitchen window."
c03,"June 1, 1847",He told Da that he does this only out of pity for so many losses in Connor’s family and only on the condition that Connor give no more trouble.
c05,"August 1, 1847",And yet she had come to get a girl.
c05,"August 1, 1847","“They are overflowing,” he said."
c08,"November 4, 1847",I think she was afraid that Mrs. Fenton would strike her too.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Her voice trembled as she told me that she has decided to write to her family back in England to tell them that it would be best if she and Mr. Hall returned there in the spring.
c07,"October 2, 1847",It makes me miss Grandda too.
c05,"August 1, 1847","From now on, I will take her advice and try to use my book for reflection."
c05,"August 1, 1847",She had wronged me.
c05,"August 1, 1847","I picked up her little child and walked beside the woman, who was thin and haggard and looked as old as my ma, although she told me she was not yet twenty-four."
c08,"November 4, 1847","When I asked what she meant, she told me that Mrs. Fenton’s father had brought the family from New York to Upper Canada after the American War of Independence."
c05,"August 1, 1847","But when she called softly for me to enter and I let myself inside, my spirits sank, for she was not alone."
c09,"December 1, 1847",More than once Mrs. Hall scolded her for not being quiet while her father slept.
c04,"July 3, 1847",How I ache to see Michael.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Or, rather, I should say that he was wrenched from Connor’s arms, for Connor did not want to let him go, saying that he would die in that hospital for certain."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I was too determined to catch the little thief.
c08,"November 4, 1847","Lucy had been out of sorts all day, so Mrs. Hall put her down in her own bed."
c09,"December 1, 1847",They want us to take Lucy to Sherbrooke.
c05,"August 1, 1847","I left the poor woman at the sheds, where she was told that there was no food to be had at the moment."
c05,"August 1, 1847","She has a gentle smile, clear blue eyes and a voice that sounds like a fine melody."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I heard two women talking this morning as they waited to be admitted to the house.
c04,"July 3, 1847",But she would change her mind if she met Mrs. Johnson.
c02,"May 1, 1847",One woman wept as she knelt over a man who had collapsed at the side of the road.
c04,"July 3, 1847","It took me longer than I would like to admit to come to my senses and to shout after him, “Thief!"
c05,"August 1, 1847",She told me that many of those who are nursing the ill have sickened and died.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Not another word was said about Mrs. Fenton’s accusations.
c05,"August 1, 1847","She is English and, hearing of so many orphans advertised for service, had come to look for a girl."
c03,"June 1, 1847",Da and the captain looked at each other for what seemed like ages.
c04,"July 3, 1847",He said he wanted to earn his keep and put money aside for when Da got back on his feet.
c05,"August 1, 1847","His da kept working until at last he, too, died from want of food."
c08,"November 4, 1847",He failed.
c06,"September 1, 1847",Mrs. Fenton must have been listening to us at least part of the time.
c08,"November 4, 1847","Nearing said that he was lucky to be alive, although he confided to Mrs. Lyons and me that his arm is very bad and that he might lose it."
c03,"June 1, 1847",Your family can never visit you where you lie or point out your resting place to those who come after you.
c04,"July 3, 1847",But I did not know where to find him or the name of his employer.
c05,"August 1, 1847","She knows nothing about me, but still she cares about my happiness and well-being."
c09,"December 1, 1847","I wrapped it in a bit of cloth, tied it with a twine bow and set it on a chair at the ready."
c06,"September 1, 1847","“You must not take offence,” she told me."
c09,"December 1, 1847",I waved until she was out of sight and called goodbye until my throat was sore.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I will try again now.
c05,"August 1, 1847","The letter was from the postmaster in Bytown, near where my uncle lived."
c04,"July 3, 1847","“You’re stealing from the sick.” He shoved everything into the blanket, grabbed up all four ends, and ran."
c09,"December 1, 1847","She had been wishing she could go, but was reluctant to leave Mrs. Hall."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I dared not move as she circled me, even when — I am sure of it — she sniffed me and, sounding a wee bit disappointed, pronounced me “clean enough for now, I suppose.” She then shepherded me up another much narrower set of stairs and along a dark hall to a door."
c02,"May 1, 1847",The great ugly girl from the next berth started to raise her hand as well.
c08,"November 4, 1847",She thinks the world of Mr. Hall.
c07,"October 2, 1847",I shook my head.
c05,"August 1, 1847",She sank back against the filthy straw and said that she had imagined mountains of butter and rivers of milk.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I let myself in without trying to hide that I had been gone.
c05,"August 1, 1847","I have never tasted jam, but I did not tell her that."
c02,"May 1, 1847",How she wailed.
c08,"November 4, 1847",She thinks she is quite able to look after Mrs. Hall and feels that Mrs. Fenton does not trust her to do so.
c05,"August 1, 1847","When I nodded, he said he was sorry and that if he had known that — and known me — he would not have taken it."
c05,"August 1, 1847","My
 ears burned, but I kept my mouth shut and refused even to turn around and look at Mrs. Fenton."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall says that he is cheerier now that Lucy is here.
c05,"August 1, 1847",There is a big slit halfway down the mattress cover so that I can reach in and even out the straw when it gets lumpy.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Mr. Stuart McEwen was a gruff man who grumbled about Michael’s leaving suddenly.
c09,"December 1, 1847",It was a brand new little book filled with blank pages.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mrs. Lyons has also left for a while.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Ma is worried about Patrick, who has been whining and crying all day."
c04,"July 3, 1847",It was so hot that I felt faint once or twice.
c03,"June 1, 1847",I wish this voyage would end.
c04,"July 3, 1847","When we were finally allowed off the ship three days ago, it was to board a steamer for Montreal, which is said to be two days’ journey upstream."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I could not believe my eyes!
c08,"November 4, 1847","Where it could not be blown, it piled up in high drifts."
c06,"September 1, 1847",But I have not done much fancy work and Ma usually showed me exactly what she wanted me to do.
c02,"May 1, 1847",And to think that some of these grumblers were starving little more than a fortnight ago!
c06,"September 1, 1847",She is very curious about Ireland and about what happened to my family.
c05,"August 1, 1847","My first reflection is this: I must pay far more attention to the task at hand when I am ironing, for heated irons are dangerous things."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mrs. Hall says that we will use the tallow to make candles.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I see some of the men and women who come to take the youngest ones into their homes.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Finally, he said that we would receive one week’s rations at a time and that each family must take turns sending someone above to cook meals."
c05,"August 1, 1847",She looked at me in astonishment.
c01,"April 30, 1847",It has sent many to their deaths and now it drives us from our home.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mrs. Lyons was with her.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Then one cried out in dismay, “She’s a lad, not a lass.” Still Connor punched and kicked until finally one of the mates hit him from behind and he crumpled onto the deck of the ship."
c07,"October 2, 1847","Mr. Fenton drove Mrs. Fenton, Fanny and me back in the wagon."
c03,"June 1, 1847",He says one moose will feed a family for the whole winter.
c03,"June 1, 1847",I heard her whisper to Da that he has lost his appetite and feels hot to the touch.
c02,"May 1, 1847",How the storm went on.
c03,"June 1, 1847",What if there was a fever on Anna’s ship?
c05,"August 1, 1847",We had not travelled far before Fanny crawled back to sit beside me.
c04,"July 3, 1847",She got Connor to agree to return in a week’s time for an answer.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Michael says that sailors are accustomed to such
 fates."
c02,"May 1, 1847",The hold grew so rank with sick and foul air that someone — I do not know who — proposed to break open the hatch to get some air.
c08,"November 4, 1847",She muttered to herself for much of the morning.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Along with some brothers, I began to remove
 some of the foul old stuff and replace it with the new."
c02,"May 1, 1847",The storm came upon us like an army of banshees.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Nothing I do is fast enough or thorough enough for her.
c08,"November 4, 1847","So this afternoon when Mrs. Fenton and Mrs. Lyons were busy in the kitchen, I told Lucy some fairy stories."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Tommy touched my arm and asked if the man was a relation of mine.
c05,"August 1, 1847",It wasn’t there!
c04,"July 3, 1847",Sister Marie-France had also visited the sheds and had discovered that there is a Joanna Leary lately listed among the dead.
c04,"July 3, 1847","But, if anything, the news was worse: Connor did not know if his brother had died on Grosse Isle or if he had survived."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I know it is wrong for me to say this, but he smelled of death."
c03,"June 1, 1847",He was such a small thing and so sweet and quick to smile.
c02,"May 1, 1847",At long last the storm abated.
c07,"October 2, 1847",I wish I had something to give her in return.
c04,"July 3, 1847",“Be careful what you wish for.” To think I ever believed those words to be nonsense.
c08,"November 4, 1847",“But why didn’t you tell me?” she asked him.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Somewhere a woman sang a soft lullaby to a whimpering baby.
c03,"June 1, 1847",I think he was remembering Mrs. Kelleher.
c05,"August 1, 1847","I watched as we crossed the city and took the ferry across the St. Lawrence River, and later on the Richelieu."
c07,"October 2, 1847","But I made myself sit down for a moment and told myself that I had walked the same route with Fanny at least twice and that if I concentrated, I would find the path."
c04,"July 3, 1847",The fairies rewarded him for his singing and his courtesy by removing the ugly hump from his back.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Mrs. Donnell has aches and fever.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Then she scooped Lucy into her arms and comforted her.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I heard them laughing long after they had reached the top, and a terrible pain stabbed my heart."
c03,"June 1, 1847","Da organized a few men to catch some of the soft
 rainwater to drink, as the ship’s water smells and tastes foul."
c09,"December 1, 1847","Mrs. Hall kissed her and smiled at me, which was a great relief."
c06,"September 1, 1847",It took me forever to get a peel off in one strip.
c09,"December 1, 1847","I also have the coat Mrs. Hall cut down for me, and an old pair of her
 boots that she gave me."
c04,"July 3, 1847",He turned up his nose at me and walked away without a word.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Perhaps the priest in the town near Uncle’s former residence had encountered Michael and told him of my whereabouts.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Mrs. Kelleher would not relinquish her grip on Thomas.
c05,"August 1, 1847","“You are an angel,” she managed to say after she had drunk her fill."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I was left to polish the silver and clean the knives, while watching a pot on the fire."
c03,"June 1, 1847",Then there are those who have no loved ones in hospital and who deem themselves healthy.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Together she and I moved all the furniture so that we could take the carpets up one by one.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Connor agreed.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I woke up this morning feeling better.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I heard the captain tell Da that those new to the sea often take ill.
c04,"July 3, 1847",But I did not.
c04,"July 3, 1847",The most difficult are the carpets.
c08,"November 4, 1847",She learns too that he is so wise that people from all around come to him with their problems and he solves them all in a fair way that pleases all parties.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“From the same place as I get everything,” he told me."
c02,"May 1, 1847",She left Patrick with me and went above to cook.
c04,"July 3, 1847",My fingers trembled as I reached to touch her face.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Michael raised his hand to volunteer.
c02,"May 1, 1847",What if I ruined the meal?
c08,"November 4, 1847","I tried to explain, but she wouldn’t even let me start."
c02,"May 1, 1847","Others took up the
 cry, and Da had to argue mightily to get them to see that this would put the ship in danger of foundering."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Her eyes were open so I smiled and waved.
c03,"June 1, 1847","I tried to hold myself stiff so as not to betray any trembling, but I breathed such a huge sigh of relief when the doctor passed me by that he turned to look at me again."
c05,"August 1, 1847","I thought about my
 book all day and wondered what had become of it."
c05,"August 1, 1847",It is as if people think the only way to solve the problem is to turn back time so that the Irish had not come in the first place.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Kevin and Kerry are also feeling poorly.
c02,"May 1, 1847","“I have heard that a person’s opinions may break his nose or even cut his throat,” I said."
c04,"July 3, 1847",More than once I saw two poor souls side by side on the same cot.
c03,"June 1, 1847",The captain had us all line up in rows.
c08,"November 4, 1847",I was sure of it.
c06,"September 1, 1847",First you have to boil the kernels.
c09,"December 1, 1847",He told Connor where I had gone.
c04,"July 3, 1847",He did not come.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I was sweeping the upstairs hall (we have all been given chores) when I heard a child cry.
c05,"August 1, 1847","“So it’s only 
strange
 countrymen that you steal from?” I asked."
c02,"May 1, 1847",I asked what irregularities the committee is to watch for.
c03,"June 1, 1847",But we are not.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Then with a trembling hand he closed her eyes.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Michael and I are helping him.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I slipped away to the sheds again, feeling emboldened by my success the past two times."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Da had always supposed that everything would
 be different across the ocean."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mr. Hall is as grief stricken as Mrs. Hall.
c05,"August 1, 1847","“Not everyone,” he answered."
c04,"July 3, 1847",The newspaper sounds as if it is written by an Englishman!
c05,"August 1, 1847",“He thinks I died in the fever sheds.
c09,"December 1, 1847","The economy was bad, there were so many people seeking employment, and there was widespread resentment against all the Irish who had flooded the city."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Michael is alive.
c01,"April 30, 1847",Leaving is like being granted three wishes all at once.
c06,"September 1, 1847","She supplied the candle stubs, grease from pot skimmings, and old bones."
c02,"May 1, 1847",But there are none who will betray him.
c07,"October 2, 1847","It will keep my feet from getting so cold when I climb out of bed in the morning, and will brighten my room."
c08,"November 4, 1847",It was a small likeness of Mr. Hall’s mother.
c06,"September 1, 1847","She says I will need both for the coming winter, and that the one the sisters gave me will not be warm enough."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Tears sprang to my eyes when Connor told me this.
c09,"December 1, 1847",It was then that I knew everything had worked out for the best.
c03,"June 1, 1847",He did not say another word.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“He is fevered,” he said."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Her return will brighten the days.
c05,"August 1, 1847",But that is not the way of the world.
c03,"June 1, 1847",He says that the government of Canada will send an inspector to the ship.
c05,"August 1, 1847","I whirled around, my heart soaring."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Some of them wait impatiently to cook.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Moreover, I did harm to other girls who had lost their parents and who relied on the charity of the sisters and the goodness of women like Mrs. Johnson who were willing to take into their homes girls who had none save the sisters to vouch for their character."
c07,"October 2, 1847","Then she begs me to tell her stories, which I gladly do, for the silence of the house weighs heavily on me."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Two little sisters died of hunger and fever.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Does he know that I am alive?
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mr. Fenton is to drive us there in two days’ time.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I reeled to hear this news.
c07,"October 2, 1847","Nor of my da, buried somewhere in Montreal without a marker on his grave."
c07,"October 2, 1847",It was Mrs. Hall.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Some of it is being smoked and some is being salted.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Never have I seen so
 many people so ill and so crowded together."
c05,"August 1, 1847",She smiled and closed her eyes.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Our days pass in quiet industry.
c09,"December 1, 1847","I have my quilt, which is nearly finished, and the scraps of fabric for my little rug, which I intend to work on in my spare time."
c07,"October 2, 1847",He never minded the priests when they scolded him for such talk.
c07,"October 2, 1847",I don’t mind so much as I used to.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Nearing pulled up the sleigh and gazed down at Mrs. Hall.
c05,"August 1, 1847","I was dispatched up and down the stairs to take up fresh cups, saucers, plates and spoons and to return back down the stairs with dirty ones, which Mrs. Coteau had me stack neatly on the sideboard."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Mrs. Coteau was very cross with me.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Fanny came over today to lighten the workload and brighten the mood of the house.
c04,"July 3, 1847","So I was the one who did the describing, and the description I gave him was of my da."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Sister Marie-France bade me go to confession at the next opportunity and, in the meantime, to fetch a scrub brush and bucket and make the hall floor gleam."
c02,"May 1, 1847",I do not want Ma to see me.
c05,"August 1, 1847","A few moments passed, and the weight of her frail body grew heavy against my arm."
c02,"May 1, 1847",I had fallen asleep and was woken by the calm and silence.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I helped Mrs. Hall with the little girls and slept on a clean straw mattress on the floor with a blanket to cover myself.
c04,"July 3, 1847",He had gone to the sheds to search for Da.
c02,"May 1, 1847",She is the rudest and least handsome girl I ever saw.
c08,"November 4, 1847","“Grandfather gave it to him, but he says it’s too grand to wear."
c08,"November 4, 1847","And one night when he would kiss her, she lets him."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Perhaps she had word about Michael.
c02,"May 1, 1847","When the name Leary was called, Da stepped forward with our tickets, and we were permitted to go below."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I said that this was a good idea but that I could not afford to pay for such a notice.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Still Ma did not move.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Kerry had died the day we departed by steamer to Montreal.
c04,"July 3, 1847","At each turn I spotted him, only to have him disappear from sight."
c07,"October 2, 1847",It is hard to imagine any simpler chore.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Maybe she was even spying on us, for as soon as she heard me address Fanny as just that — Fanny — she became furious."
c07,"October 2, 1847","He went to help Mr. Hall, who was behind the house planing boards to make them smooth for the baby’s casket."
c05,"August 1, 1847",It seems an awful contradiction.
c05,"August 1, 1847","When I turned to leave, she asked if it was true that I wrote every day in a small book."
c06,"September 1, 1847",What a ridiculous question!
c07,"October 2, 1847",The worry and the pallor on Mrs. Hall’s face put me in mind of my own ma when wee Patrick fell ill aboard ship.
c09,"December 1, 1847",She unwrapped it eagerly and was not at all disappointed.
c08,"November 4, 1847",But Mr. Hall saw.
c06,"September 1, 1847",She is reading one now about a Scotsman named Mungo Park who visited the deepest parts of Africa.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I am not an orphan.
c02,"May 1, 1847",But I did not feel lucky.
c03,"June 1, 1847",The two had come to respect each other.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Still, I know I am improving because at first
 Mrs. Hall tore out most of my stitches and said it would be better to start again."
c06,"September 1, 1847",In the evenings — at least before the barn raising started — he works on some project or other.
c09,"December 1, 1847",He reads to her every night before she goes to bed.
c03,"June 1, 1847","A woman was ordered to the hospital, but her children who are declared healthy may not go with her."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Had some other misfortune befallen him?
c03,"June 1, 1847","Then Da said, “Come, Eileen,” and helped Ma from the ranks."
c07,"October 2, 1847","Neither the sister’s letter nor mine had produced any reply, and the newspaper that had printed my notice had received no reply regarding me."
c07,"October 2, 1847","When I went down in the morning to stir the fire, the kitchen was already snug
 and warm."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Yesterday, after the fire was properly banked and Mrs. Coteau well tucked in her small room behind the kitchen, I hunted in my usual hiding place for my little book."
c05,"August 1, 1847",It must be from Michael — or from Uncle Liam — for who else could it be?
c05,"August 1, 1847","Tommy’s ma died of the fever on the ship, and he had made up his mind to rely only on himself when he finally landed, alone."
c09,"December 1, 1847","But her face brimmed with joy, and she hugged me and told me how happy she was that my brother was found."
c09,"December 1, 1847","Mr. Hall must have taken a bad turn, and Mrs. Hall must be waiting for the doctor."
c07,"October 2, 1847","She barked at me to finish my sweeping, but I knew she was only trying to hide her own grief at little Catherine’s passing."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Mrs. Hall surprised me by suggesting I put a notice in the newspaper asking that anyone looking for me should inquire at the newspaper office, where Mrs. Hall would leave information about where I might be found."
c09,"December 1, 1847",They plan to stay in Sherbrooke until Mr. Hall is strong and able to get around.
c06,"September 1, 1847",What a nasty woman!
c02,"May 1, 1847",So do some of the other passengers.
c08,"November 4, 1847",The horses’ breath drifted back in clouds toward us.
c03,"June 1, 1847",She blames herself.
c04,"July 3, 1847","But he told me he would come again as often as he could and that if he found Da, he would get word to me."
c07,"October 2, 1847",The priest had had no sign of Michael.
c05,"August 1, 1847",It was heavy work.
c08,"November 4, 1847","“It’s stuck,” she said."
c06,"September 1, 1847","Mrs. Hall gave me some yarn and some needles and asked me to show her some stitches, but I forgot how to cast on!"
c02,"May 1, 1847",Mrs. Tattersall is beside herself.
c02,"May 1, 1847","“I’m no baby,” I said."
c04,"July 3, 1847",She was kind but stern when she told me I must not wander off on my own.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“Found it,” he muttered — and those two words shocked me more than I can say."
c09,"December 1, 1847",The day was cold but bright and the snow hard and crisp under the runners of the sleigh.
c06,"September 1, 1847",My cheeks burned as I fumbled with the yarn.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mrs. Hall goes often to visit Catherine under the oak tree and sometimes sits and stares out the window at the little hill and the small marker on it.
c08,"November 4, 1847","The evening was starless because of the clouds, and there was no moon to be seen."
c05,"August 1, 1847","I started to cry again, right there in the square."
c02,"May 1, 1847","Da says they will be lit at seven every morning, if the weather is fine enough, and put out at sunset."
c05,"August 1, 1847","The Irish seem to be the talk of Montreal, and few have anything good to say."
c05,"August 1, 1847","How I wish we were back home, well-fed and happy, among our friends."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I called for them to stop.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I remembered the first poor soul I had seen and how I could not tell at first if it was man or woman.
c09,"December 1, 1847",He shouted at me until I left the room and was not content until I had shut the door.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I spent the day ironing and thinking about what Sister Marie-France had said.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Mrs. Hall says that it took her husband and many men more than two years of chopping trees to make the
 clearing as large as it is."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Then I raced down the stairs, but too late."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Nearing was on his way to tell Mrs. Webley.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I cannot imagine so much snow.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Sister Marie-France sent my letter today.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mr. Hall went into Sherbrooke yesterday to sell the hide from the ox he butchered a few weeks ago.
c05,"August 1, 1847","She told everyone who passed that she had two small children and that her husband and her third child had perished, one on the passage, the other in the sheds."
c09,"December 1, 1847",I felt my cheeks burn.
c04,"July 3, 1847","And perhaps it is as well, for if I am left alone in this world — as I fear now that I am in my little bed — I will have to depend on a good reference to find new employment."
c02,"May 1, 1847","In fact, I was glad to go up today so that I could breathe some fresh air."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I went round the farthest edges of the crowd and slipped into a shed.
c05,"August 1, 1847","First thing this morning, I spoke to Sister Marie-France and asked her to write one more letter for me."
c02,"May 1, 1847",But Da says things are hard for Irish there and that Canada is a better place.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I went straight to the kitchen and stood there for a moment.
c07,"October 2, 1847","While he was in Sherbrooke, Mr. Hall accepted employment from a logging company."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Well, she is only seven and a Protestant to boot."
c04,"July 3, 1847","“But she did not invite them,” Peggy declared triumphantly."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I was pushing a cart laden with damp and heavy straw across the cobbles when I came to a jarring halt.
c05,"August 1, 1847",“Anything of yours?” she said.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Catherine is a little better, but she does not want to play."
c02,"May 1, 1847",A man who has his own land is a man who is always easily found.
c07,"October 2, 1847","She says that once all preparations are made for winter, she will help me cut down an old dress of hers to remake into one for me."
c05,"August 1, 1847","She chattered about her visit to Montreal and the pictures she had seen of the latest fashions in England, and did not seem to mind how quiet I was."
c05,"August 1, 1847",She had just this day received a letter that concerned me.
c05,"August 1, 1847",More cleaning.
c04,"July 3, 1847",They were thirsty too.
c09,"December 1, 1847",She seemed lost in thought and worry.
c08,"November 4, 1847",But he said it was not as bad as one year early in his marriage when he was in his workshop making chairs for the parlour.
c05,"August 1, 1847","I made my way back to the nuns, who took me in without a word."
c08,"November 4, 1847","The water in the
 little jug in my room is frozen solid when I get out of bed in the morning and the edge of my blanket is covered in ice where my breath freezes on it."
c03,"June 1, 1847",I saw patches of pink on her cheeks.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Da said we mustn’t panic, although I noticed that he fingered his little tin St. Joseph medal, which he always does when he’s whispering a prayer."
c03,"June 1, 1847","Da, beside me, did not stir."
c03,"June 1, 1847",Some say that there are two dozen ships and more waiting for medical inspection and to send their ill ashore.
c09,"December 1, 1847","Mrs. Lyons offered to make some tea, and Mrs. Fenton accepted, but Mr. Fenton said that he could not stay."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I promptly lost my way in the bustling city and was forced to stop a gentleman in the street to ask again for directions.
c07,"October 2, 1847","She always has some piece of work to hand, and she shows me what she is doing and how it is done."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Nearing grabbed her hand before she could lift the blanket.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Another tells of two families who died from eating the diseased carcass of a horse.
c04,"July 3, 1847",When we reached the ship I could not make myself look at Da.
c07,"October 2, 1847",They will be gone for a few weeks.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I stood with my mouth agape as I gazed at the rows of wretched patients lying cramped and filthy in beds.
c08,"November 4, 1847",But time goes by and she learns that her husband is a good and patient man when she is a good and patient wife.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Mrs. Coteau was to inform her directly if I was found to be unsuitable in any way.
c04,"July 3, 1847",And how I wish this country was not so big.
c07,"October 2, 1847","To my shame, I found myself fighting back tears."
c09,"December 1, 1847",I know Lucy will miss you and so will I.” She also told me not to worry because this was all a long way off.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Or Uncle.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I wonder if she has forgotten me.
c06,"September 1, 1847",She recites them to me.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I have let Connor down and feel terrible because of it.
c04,"July 3, 1847","It was about how immigrants — the 
Irish
 immigrants — at
 the fever sheds were selling the bread and oatmeal they were given and were using the coppers they got in exchange to buy liquor!"
c04,"July 3, 1847","This morning while I was outside hanging clothes with another girl, I heard my name."
c06,"September 1, 1847",No one is as hard a worker as my own dear da.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Da danced on everyone’s birthday.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Connor is grateful.
c02,"May 1, 1847",The ships in the water jostle each other as roughly as the people on land do.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Hall hurried inside to prepare for her trip.
c04,"July 3, 1847","A man came for me in a wagon and drove me through the bustling streets, and everywhere I heard a language I do not understand."
c09,"December 1, 1847","Hall said that you like to write things down,” she said."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Some of the older boys were asked to keep the deck clean and the cistern filled with water.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I looked around for someone who might help, but there was no one."
c02,"May 1, 1847",More people are ill.
c01,"April 30, 1847","He and Ma, Michael, wee Patrick and I are to walk to Dublin, where we will take a steamer to Liverpool in England."
c04,"July 3, 1847","After I was deemed clean, I was put to work scouring pots with sand and then rinsing and drying them thoroughly."
c09,"December 1, 1847",How is he to manage now?
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mrs. Lyons has some old flannel that she says I can cut and sew to one side for the backing.
c04,"July 3, 1847",She has found me a position.
c03,"June 1, 1847","The captain
 could not say how long the quarantine will last."
c02,"May 1, 1847",I hate ships as much as I hate steamers.
c02,"May 1, 1847",The rude girl gobbled her food like a pig.
c03,"June 1, 1847",But it is almost done.” We stood beside Da for a long time.
c03,"June 1, 1847","His eyes were small and muddy behind his spectacles, and he stared so hard at me that I thought he was giving me the evil eye."
c05,"August 1, 1847",What will become of him?
c05,"August 1, 1847","Instead, I pretended that I had not heard a word."
c07,"October 2, 1847",“You have made yourself a member of our family.
c05,"August 1, 1847","She had no choice but to leave where she was, carrying one babe in her arms and tugging the other along behind her."
c05,"August 1, 1847",The house stands in the middle of a clearing.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Also, the seams did not show, the way every single stitch on a quilt does."
c09,"December 1, 1847","But when he got there, he was disappointed."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Mrs. Johnson merely orders people about.
c02,"May 1, 1847","While we stood above deck after the service, someone spotted a shark."
c03,"June 1, 1847",I sat up with such a start that I banged my head on the ceiling.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I do not want her ever to be sorry for the effort she has made to help me.
c09,"December 1, 1847",I was sorry to leave my bed and my little chest of drawers.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Ma was gone and now so was Da.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Mr. Hall finally came in from pulling stumps, saw it and sorted through it, calling out to Mrs. Hall who each letter and parcel was from."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I had left it in its usual place — between the blanket and the ropes of my cot.
c02,"May 1, 1847",We are to board our ship tomorrow.
c09,"December 1, 1847","As Connor told the story, he had lived for several weeks with the family who took in Daniel and who, he said, were taking good care of him — better than Connor himself could have done."
c04,"July 3, 1847",And that was that.
c07,"October 2, 1847",She says she is glad to have a friend near her own age close by.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Some we passed looked like wraiths risen from their shrouds, so hollow were their eyes and so sharply did their bones show through their grey skin."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Whatever letter the peel makes when it strikes the ground is supposed to be the first letter of the name of the man they will eventually marry.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall smiled when she saw me.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Tears rolled down Lucy’s cheeks as she spilled out the whole story.
c02,"May 1, 1847",There is hardly any space to walk on the floor (is a floor called a floor in a ship?
c04,"July 3, 1847",Nellie Johnson came and stood beside me this morning while I hung out the linens.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Mrs. Hall was busy all day nursing Catherine, who is feverish and vomiting."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Tomorrow I have to give Mrs. Hall my answer.
c04,"July 3, 1847","She must have worried that there were fairies about for she thanked me sweetly for the story — 
three times
!"
c04,"July 3, 1847","I can no more imagine leaving Ma than Connor can imagine leaving Kerry, and I wanted to tell her that we will find her again when she is well and strong."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Hall made a bed on the sofa for Lucy and she played quietly under her blankets all day.
c01,"April 30, 1847","When we leave, we will go to a place where people eat meat and drink milk every day."
c09,"December 1, 1847",He says he will come to get us first thing in the morning so that we can set out for Sherbrooke.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Connor had to stay below and clean even though he would rather go above.
c03,"June 1, 1847",I dream about the potatoes Ma used to pull from the fire.
c05,"August 1, 1847","She said that my actions displayed lack of gratitude and, worse, lack of humility."
c04,"July 3, 1847","But when I promised Connor that I would take care of Daniel, he left off his struggle."
c02,"May 1, 1847",He makes meat sausage in the autumn that he says smells glorious as it sizzles over the fire.
c04,"July 3, 1847","In the end, it was a lad no older than myself who told me the route."
c04,"July 3, 1847","But I could not rest even then, for the kitchen floor had to be scrubbed from one end to the other."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I think it weighs on Lucy too.
c02,"May 1, 1847","His temper flared when I said that
 stealing is a sin."
c06,"September 1, 1847","She reminds me a little of Anna, who was always full of talk, usually wishing for things she had heard about but never seen."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Two more passengers have been sent to their rest in the sea.
c03,"June 1, 1847",He glanced up at our berth where Da was still sleeping.
c05,"August 1, 1847","As soon as the breakfast pans were scrubbed I was set to work with Mrs. Coteau making sandwiches
 and slicing cakes."
c06,"September 1, 1847",He would have succeeded.
c03,"June 1, 1847",He boasts that he will learn to hunt when he gets to Canada and that no wild beast will be safe when he is about.
c02,"May 1, 1847","They are big wooden boxes lined with bricks, and they have metal grates set on them."
c06,"September 1, 1847","The Americans sent maize to Ireland for the starving, but it was so hard and difficult to digest that it made people ill. Now I know why."
c05,"August 1, 1847",It was not to be found.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Lyons said I looked as if I’d seen a ghost.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Mrs. Coteau says that he is an important man and that his business interests keep him busy, so he is not home for every evening meal."
c05,"August 1, 1847","As for my da, how can you call someone ignorant when he is one of the finest carpenters in the county."
c02,"May 1, 1847","Patrick was fussing, so Ma sent me to cook the oatmeal."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I felt such a panic as I stared at the trees around me — they all looked the same.
c09,"December 1, 1847",You have been a part of this family.
c08,"November 4, 1847",I think she is worried that Mr. Hall has not returned yet.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Then you tie the maize in a bag and beat it with a stick — Mrs. Lyons showed me how — until the bran, which is the outside of the kernel, falls off."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I dress quickly and steal down to the kitchen to stir up the fire and put on the kettle.
c06,"September 1, 1847",Fanny came today just to see me!
c09,"December 1, 1847","She said that Mr. Hall was asleep, so there was nothing for me to worry about."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Only when I drew even with him did I see who he was.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mrs. Lyons will leave in a few days’ time.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Everything was so pretty.
c07,"October 2, 1847","Instead she lies on the sofa and either sleeps, or gazes at her mother with dull eyes."
c09,"December 1, 1847",What a glorious day!
c04,"July 3, 1847",After that I was to be shown my duties.
c09,"December 1, 1847","Lucy was the most excited, as she was sure it must be her ma and da."
c03,"June 1, 1847","Eileen Cairns, eight, and Thomas Kelleher, ten, died during the night."
c08,"November 4, 1847",And Mr. Hall has been very badly injured.
c09,"December 1, 1847",I could hardly believe it.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Colleen followed him.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall was not satisfied and asked Sister Marie-France if she might have a moment alone with me.
c07,"October 2, 1847",A friend — that is exactly what she said!
c02,"May 1, 1847","She looked up at Da, her face as white as lace, her eyes as black as coal, and nodded."
c08,"November 4, 1847",I thought that so much snow had fallen that the house was buried and that we would never get out nor anybody get in.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Mrs. Johnson sat back in her chair to inspect me.
c08,"November 4, 1847","This morning, shortly after I had stirred the fire, I heard a noise, a whinny."
c02,"May 1, 1847",I have been so busy the past few days.
c09,"December 1, 1847",But how on earth had he found me?
c05,"August 1, 1847",The new arrivals continue to be adopted by generous families.
c04,"July 3, 1847",The children ran down the stairs to greet him.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Two men appeared and grabbed Connor.
c08,"November 4, 1847",So I told Mrs. Hall that no harm was meant.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Connor says that Colleen is covered from head
 to toe with blotches and that his da sleeps fitfully."
c03,"June 1, 1847",“But what are we going to do?” I asked.
c08,"November 4, 1847",So frigid was it that a nail froze to his bare hand before he could hammer it into the piece of wood he was working on.
c04,"July 3, 1847",It was Da’s medal — no doubt of it.
c04,"July 3, 1847","No matter how long I pounded at them, it was deemed insufficient to shake loose every speck of dirt."
c09,"December 1, 1847","She gave me a beautiful handkerchief that she had embroidered with autumn leaves, for she said she knew how I loved the colours."
c04,"July 3, 1847","“And the man it belongs to?” “
Belonged
 to,” he said."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I did not find Da or anyone who knew him.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“I will thank you to keep your heathen fairy stories to yourself,” she said."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall calculates that they ate more than 150 pounds of beef in the ten days they were here and five loaves of bread every day in addition to buckets of soup and great quantities of butter and tea and sugar.
c04,"July 3, 1847",There is cutlery.
c05,"August 1, 1847","At long last we found another inn, this one more to Mrs. Fenton’s liking."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I know Lucy would be heartbroken if you were to leave us.” I thanked her for her kindness.
c08,"November 4, 1847",“You people are no better than animals.” She said that she had warned Mrs. Hall not to take on an Irish girl because the Irish are lazy beggars.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Ma says we are stacked and stored like peat.
c04,"July 3, 1847",The brother knew only that Michael had left his employer on a moment’s notice.
c07,"October 2, 1847",I wish Patrick could have been laid out as prettily.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“And that is why when you see a fairy or even think that one is about, you must always be respectful,” I told her."
c03,"June 1, 1847",He was weeping.
c08,"November 4, 1847","Mrs. Lyons said that Mrs. Fenton’s family and
 many others tried to sell parts of their land for a few barrels of flour, but found no buyers."
c04,"July 3, 1847",But what will become of me?
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Lyons smiled and nodded.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mrs. Hall was up the whole night with Catherine.
c04,"July 3, 1847","After I had beaten them to Claire’s satisfaction, we dragged them back inside and replaced the furniture we had moved."
c08,"November 4, 1847","“It’s from Papa’s watch,” she said."
c02,"May 1, 1847",No one is allowed to smoke or light a fire below deck.
c08,"November 4, 1847","Mr. Fenton and Fanny drove over in a cutter to take Mrs. Hall, Lucy and me for a ride."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I wish Ma were here to see what I have done — she would be pleased.
c07,"October 2, 1847","Then you plait the strips into a loose rope, coil them into an oval and sew them together."
c08,"November 4, 1847","He said that the demand for timber is so great in Europe that the men were pressed to work well into the evenings, piling up logs by the light of fires."
c05,"August 1, 1847","For myself, I found it not so bad."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I am beside myself with wanting to know.
c08,"November 4, 1847",At night the wind came up and blew the snow everywhere.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Uncle Liam awaits news of us and we of him.
c05,"August 1, 1847","I had no friend in the city save Connor, and I did not know where to find him."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Today I went to the emigrant sheds and worked side by side with the sisters.
c04,"July 3, 1847","He and Michael met often in the square not far away, and he said he would look for him there tomorrow."
c01,"April 30, 1847","She says, if anything happens, what will become of us without friends and neighbours close by?"
c05,"August 1, 1847",I slept three nights ago in my very own room for the first time ever with my very own bed and a mattress filled with straw.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Mrs. Hall protested and said that I was quite healthy, but Mrs. Fenton said that she was being foolish by taking someone like me into her home."
c04,"July 3, 1847",“What about Uncle Liam?” I asked.
c04,"July 3, 1847",He reached out and touched Ma’s face.
c05,"August 1, 1847","It is scarcely as big as one of the cupboards in Mrs. Johnson’s house, but it seems quite snug."
c02,"May 1, 1847","She is in the top berth, like me."
c04,"July 3, 1847","We would have found a way, and we would still be together."
c02,"May 1, 1847","Within the hour, the crewmen had sown Mr. Tattersall into a shroud and weighted the shroud with a stone."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Groaning, Fanny did as she was told."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Also, it is astonishingly easy to let a hot iron linger a little too long upon an article of clothing or a crisp white sheet when the ironer (me) gets caught up in relating a story to another girl, and thus to leave a scald mark or even to burn the article right the way through."
c09,"December 1, 1847",She ran ahead of me and her mother bundled her up into her arms.
c01,"April 30, 1847",I am not afraid.
c07,"October 2, 1847","I wish my quilt was finished, for a deep chill has settled on us all and I could use the extra cover at night."
c02,"May 1, 1847","“If that is so, then why are the landlords and the merchants not charged for stealing the bounty of Ireland and selling it abroad while the people of Ireland starve to death?” he demanded."
c05,"August 1, 1847","I pulled the cart back and tried to guide the wheel around, but succeeded only in coming up against another crooked stone."
c09,"December 1, 1847",She declared that it was the finest shawl she had ever seen and wrapped it around her shoulders.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Uncle Liam has moved!
c05,"August 1, 1847","I felt sorry for him, for, like me, he had lost his family."
c05,"August 1, 1847",She said that she had a happy home but that she did not think it would stay happy if she employed someone who did not want to be there.
c04,"July 3, 1847",It seems that Michael had done the same as I.
c03,"June 1, 1847","He says they have taken Ma to the hospital on Grosse Isle (it means “large island” in French), and that there are nurses and doctors there to care for the ill. For his
 part, Michael has done nothing but grumble."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Thank goodness I did not see Ma among them.
c02,"May 1, 1847",He can be so annoying.
c02,"May 1, 1847","When he goes above, which is rarely,
 he covers his head with a shawl and stays behind his mother like a great shy hulk of a girl."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I scrubbed until my arms ached, my hands were as wrinkled as a crone’s, and my feet felt like two great rocks."
c06,"September 1, 1847",I have been thinking of Michael since morning and wondering what has become of him.
c07,"October 2, 1847",I wept until I fell asleep.
c05,"August 1, 1847","“Explain this to me,” she said, her teeth gritted as if to bite back her fury."
c03,"June 1, 1847",It was Michael.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I was afraid to go.
c03,"June 1, 1847",She did not get out of the berth today.
c04,"July 3, 1847","At last we came to a large, handsome house."
c06,"September 1, 1847","Fanny says she knows
 that he survived his expedition, for how else could he have written about it, but that she holds her breath at every turn to see how he will get out of some fresh new disaster."
c03,"June 1, 1847",The doctor was a tall dour man who never once allowed himself to smile.
c05,"August 1, 1847",The landlord then drove the rest of the family from their home and put them on a leaky ship bound for Canada.
c03,"June 1, 1847","I began to ask why Connor wasn’t watching both of his brothers, but Michael silenced me."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I thought to ask about Connor as well.
c03,"June 1, 1847","She cradles him and sings to him and tries to get him to swallow
 a little food to keep up his strength."
c03,"June 1, 1847","Da spoke to the captain, who agreed not to have Connor arrested and handed over to the authorities,
 even though his girl’s disguise clearly marked him as wanted."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall greeted us at the door.
c05,"August 1, 1847",His name is Tommy Ryan.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall sent a list.
c04,"July 3, 1847",The boy nodded.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Would I be able to find another position?
c04,"July 3, 1847","His rudeness was rewarded: Not only did the fairies refuse to remove his hump, but they added Lusmore’s to his back as well and he went away worse off than when he arrived."
c05,"August 1, 1847","I reflected on that too and reminded her that I had not fallen ill on the ship or afterward, even when I visited the sheds against her wishes."
c05,"August 1, 1847",He did not seem in the least bothered by the accusation.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I turned to Michael.
c08,"November 4, 1847","So next time she lays into you, Johanna, think of her father gnawing the bone of some poor dog."
c02,"May 1, 1847",The rations are mostly oatmeal.
c08,"November 4, 1847",At last her impatient father marries her off to the ugliest and lowliest man in the kingdom.
c06,"September 1, 1847",I think also of Connor and wonder if he has seen Daniel or has discovered what became of Kerry.
c03,"June 1, 1847",I hope she does not fall ill.
c04,"July 3, 1847",He disappeared around a corner.
c04,"July 3, 1847",She did not smile back or lift a hand to wave.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Ma says she must tell the captain, for he has a medicine chest and may be able to help."
c03,"June 1, 1847","He says there are trees for as far as a man can walk in a week, maybe even farther, and that the forests are filled with the music of birds, some of which he had never seen in Ireland."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Some folk arrived in Liverpool a week or more ago and had to spend every penny they had on lodging and food until the ship was ready to sail.
c07,"October 2, 1847","I think perhaps her parents forget that she, too, has lost someone dear to her."
c09,"December 1, 1847","According to Connor, Sister Marie-France’s
 replacement was not as organized as Sister Marie-France had been."
c02,"May 1, 1847",I will pretend to dance on it until it aches.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Sister Marie-France has said nothing, but I know she thinks I should take the position."
c05,"August 1, 1847",And I have been trying to find out where he is.
c08,"November 4, 1847",She had tugged too hard and the golden fob separated from the chain.
c09,"December 1, 1847",But the poor man.
c08,"November 4, 1847",He takes her to his wee den of a home where she is hard put to keep it clean and tidy and must learn to cook his meals without burning them and darn his socks without pricking herself and bleeding on them.
c04,"July 3, 1847","When I asked what masses, he shook his head and told me that I would see."
c06,"September 1, 1847",I am horribly out of practice.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Did he feel as sick and frightened as I did?
c09,"December 1, 1847","On the way home Lucy
 asked for a story and I told her one."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I opened the letter and began to read Sister Marie-France’s elegant script.
c04,"July 3, 1847",He says that Montreal is home to more than fifty thousand people.
c08,"November 4, 1847","She thrust them into my hands just as Mrs. Fenton appeared, drawn by Lucy’s cry."
c07,"October 2, 1847","She was looking out the window, and when she turned I saw her wipe away a tear."
c05,"August 1, 1847","I went one last time to the fever sheds with the
 sisters."
c03,"June 1, 1847","Last night as I lay wedged between Ma and Michael, I had an awful worry."
c03,"June 1, 1847","Connor has been charged with looking after his brothers: Kerry, Kevin and wee Daniel."
c06,"September 1, 1847",I do not think that Mrs. Johnson would last even two days if she changed places with Mrs. Hall.
c09,"December 1, 1847",She said that she hoped to visit one day and to sample a meal that I had made.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Her face was as stern as Mrs. Coteau’s had been when she sent me.
c04,"July 3, 1847",My employers are to be Mr. and Mrs. Johnson.
c04,"July 3, 1847","When I finally found a harried-looking man and explained what had happened, he sighed loudly and declared that things would surely be different when the new sheds at Windmill Point were ready."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I also have linen and a blanket.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Someone else muttered about being flung into the brine like rotten sheep into a pit.
c08,"November 4, 1847",The house was silent.
c07,"October 2, 1847","My heart beat very fast and my mind thought terrible thoughts, but I did it — I found the path!"
c01,"April 30, 1847","I barely remember him, I was so small when he left."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I begged Sister Marie-France to let me go after Michael, but the journey is long and difficult for a boy, never mind for a girl travelling alone."
c02,"May 1, 1847",He said it always reminds him of the psalm about going down to the sea in ships.
c02,"May 1, 1847",It was impossible to tell in the dark.
c09,"December 1, 1847","When he came out of the sick room, he and Mrs. Hall talked for a long time in hushed tones."
c07,"October 2, 1847","She even joined in, taking a third part, when we sang the song again."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I do not think that she believed I could write.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Had a wave broken through the side of the ship?
c04,"July 3, 1847",No Michael again today.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Ma told him to hush.
c02,"May 1, 1847",The little Tattersalls did likewise.
c08,"November 4, 1847","Mrs. Lyons said it was a storm brewing, but when I went outside to get more wood for the fire, it was as still as if the air had been sucked out of all life in the area."
c08,"November 4, 1847",I told her to put it back.
c06,"September 1, 1847",Mr. Hall laughed softly as he often does and said that the new barn will pay them back a hundredfold.
c03,"June 1, 1847",He didn’t say a word.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Da also said that we must air our bedding and dry-scrub our berths twice a week.
c02,"May 1, 1847","The hold seemed large enough when we came down, but it filled quickly."
c03,"June 1, 1847",They see us as bringing disease to their towns.
c02,"May 1, 1847","And a clumsy one at that.” “Pay no attention to my baby sister,” Michael said."
c04,"July 3, 1847","He also said that when I got close enough, I had only to follow the masses."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Fanny must have told him.
c08,"November 4, 1847","But in her haste, she tripped and the chain and fob flew from her hand and landed under the sofa."
c02,"May 1, 1847","Her terrible dream had come true after all, except that it is Mr. Tattersall, not her babies, who has sunk below the waves."
c05,"August 1, 1847",They have two small children and need help about the house.
c08,"November 4, 1847","I glanced at Lucy, who was staring wide-eyed at Mrs. Fenton’s angry face."
c09,"December 1, 1847",I will miss her.
c04,"July 3, 1847","She was very kind when she said it, and
 for that I am grateful."
c04,"July 3, 1847",He is all I have left.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Michael has been grinning like a fool all day but
 won’t tell me why."
c03,"June 1, 1847","“He will die if he is not attended to,” the captain said."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Mrs. Johnson turned the previous girl out only two days ago.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Whenever there was a problem with the passengers, he sent for Da and listened when Da advised him on how to proceed."
c06,"September 1, 1847",He also picks up little Catherine and rocks her in his arms until she falls asleep.
c06,"September 1, 1847","She begged to help me, and I allowed her to do so even though I had to watch constantly that she did not trample any of the plants."
c04,"July 3, 1847","We clung to each other, while Connor cradled Daniel."
c01,"April 30, 1847",That is why I have decided to write down our story.
c07,"October 2, 1847",The very worst has happened.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Those who are well will be quarantined.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I do not know what to do.
c01,"April 30, 1847","Tomorrow we leave, and Da says we may never return."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mr. Hall told Mrs. Hall that its canopy will keep the gravesite cool in the summer.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Michael had been gone for so long without a word of news.
c03,"June 1, 1847","There are more
 than one thousand ill on the island, and the nurses and doctors are worked to the bone."
c02,"May 1, 1847","And you’re only a year older than I, Michael Leary.” “A year and a half,” Michael sniffed, as if that made all the difference."
c05,"August 1, 1847","She said that Irish children play in dung heaps and that the Irish are to be seen everywhere in the country with barely the clothes to cover their modesty, when moderate labour would easily procure them what they need."
c03,"June 1, 1847",Another rumour is flying about.
c02,"May 1, 1847",The woman clamped her mouth shut as if God had reached down and pinched it closed.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Sister Marie-France said she would write to inform our uncle that Michael is on his way.
c07,"October 2, 1847",It makes me homesick to remember the bone fires that would burn at home.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I am so grateful to them.
c06,"September 1, 1847",Today I helped with the laundry.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Lyons has been with you longer than I have.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Da was a fine carpenter.
c08,"November 4, 1847",It has been so cold that the windows are frozen over and it is impossible to see through them.
c09,"December 1, 1847","After they had gone, Mrs. Fenton told us the news."
c02,"May 1, 1847","’Twas Da, his head was uplifted, and his eyes were closed."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I tried to hear what was happening, but someone was talking to me, asking if I had parents yet alive."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Then Mr. Fenton came through the front door.
c06,"September 1, 1847","I can sew straight seams, as I often helped Ma remake clothes."
c02,"May 1, 1847","I am left in charge of Patrick, who does nothing but fuss."
c05,"August 1, 1847",But how can I?
c06,"September 1, 1847","Mrs. Lyons says that in some parts of the country, apple-peeling is an occasion for get-togethers and merriment."
c04,"July 3, 1847",But a man who was with the woman scooped him up into his arms.
c08,"November 4, 1847",’Twill make her seem less daunting.” Today Mrs. Lyons became a dear friend.
c03,"June 1, 1847",It has been raining since last night.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Many were mere skin and bone.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Tommy Ryan — that young thief I met in Montreal.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Just then, two hands seized me from behind and pulled me to my feet."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Mr. Hall also spares time for his daughters.
c08,"November 4, 1847",At first she is resentful at her fall from grace.
c02,"May 1, 1847",“I’m thirteen.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall had to run some errands today and took Lucy with her.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I apologized for the trouble I had caused and said that I hoped I had caused no ill reflection on the sisters or their charges.
c07,"October 2, 1847","Mrs. Hall, who used to hum and sing for the little girls while she worked,
 is silent save for issuing instructions, and that she rarely has to do, for Mrs. Lyons knows her job well, and my routine does not vary much."
c05,"August 1, 1847","We passed another long day on the wagon, and many times got off and walked where the road was bad or had been washed away."
c02,"May 1, 1847",We left Ireland yesterday and have reached Liverpool at last.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I heard Ma crying in the night when everyone else was asleep.
c05,"August 1, 1847",It is easy to burn a hand or the side of an arm out of carelessness when picking up a heated iron.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Da does not know what the biscuit tastes like.
c03,"June 1, 1847",I think about Ma all the time and pray she will get well.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I held up the small circle of metal dented on one side, the figure on it rubbed almost away, and demanded again to know where he had got it."
c06,"September 1, 1847",I am cutting out some pieces longer than they are wide and will stitch them in a pretty pattern.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Da says that there are steamships that cross the ocean, but they
 are for rich folk, not for the likes of us."
c05,"August 1, 1847","In the end, she said that I might go."
c09,"December 1, 1847","Mr. Fenton arrived bright and early as he had promised, and loaded Lucy, Mrs. Lyons and me into the sleigh with all our bundles."
c08,"November 4, 1847","I cannot be sure, but I think she spotted what I had seen — a large bundle in the sleigh."
c06,"September 1, 1847",I don’t know what has come over me.
c05,"August 1, 1847",But I have found employment with a family near Sherbrooke.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Before the doctor passed the end of the first row,
 two more were plucked from our ranks to be sent to the hospital."
c08,"November 4, 1847",He shouted to the two men.
c09,"December 1, 1847","I am ashamed to say that while she was telling me this, I was thinking only of myself."
c07,"October 2, 1847","I pulled it out again later, when I was alone, and reread it."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Finally Mrs. Hall said she would show me.
c09,"December 1, 1847",She did not know what had become of me.
c03,"June 1, 1847","“At least we have food on the ship, however poor it is,” he said."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I laughed, for I was wearing a patched and faded dress that had been donated to the sisters and cut down to fit me."
c07,"October 2, 1847","She has been called to her brother’s house to attend the funeral of her nephew, who perished after being thrown from a horse."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I cannot believe that any of the people who were on our ship would do such a thing — nor any other immigrant either.
c04,"July 3, 1847","She is tall for her age and ungainly, and has her mother’s manner, for she regarded me with annoyance and said that I was clumsy."
c06,"September 1, 1847",A friend of Mr. Hall’s sent over two bushels of apples.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Sister Marie-France assured her that I had a good disposition and was a hard worker, but Mrs. Hall looked
 at me and waited for me to answer."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Perhaps Sister Marie-France’s letter had finally reached Uncle Liam.
c05,"August 1, 1847",He lifted the handles of the cart and dumped the straw into the water below.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“Go,” he said."
c03,"June 1, 1847","But he also said that when you are buried in the ocean, it is as good as being forgotten."
c08,"November 4, 1847","She had
 seen the sleigh as well."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Also, I am sure I do not know how the sisters bear the heat of the fire, the irons and the oppressive summer day in their woollen habits and wimples."
c02,"May 1, 1847",But Ma is not like Da.
c02,"May 1, 1847",He says it is full of promise.
c08,"November 4, 1847",How quiet and mysterious a house seems when it is cocooned in the white stuff.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Many of these, especially the women, are in despair that they will never see their loved ones again."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I repeated his directions to myself as I walked so that I would not forget them.
c02,"May 1, 1847",And such tales we have heard!
c04,"July 3, 1847","When he finally opened his eyes again, he put one arm around me and the other around Michael and held us close."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Soon he was fevered and moaning.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I had no idea how to get to the sheds, so I asked a man selling fruit on the street."
c09,"December 1, 1847","Mrs. Lyons gasped when she heard this,
 and I felt hot tears run down my cheeks."
c04,"July 3, 1847","“Johanna, you must come,” he said."
c01,"April 30, 1847",He says it is our only hope.
c05,"August 1, 1847","At the same time, the city fathers worry that the many destitute will become a burden on the public purse."
c04,"July 3, 1847",But I did not give up.
c04,"July 3, 1847","She opened her mouth to speak, but then plainly thought better of it, for she turned and flounced away."
c03,"June 1, 1847",I have Uncle Liam and his letters to thank for that.
c02,"May 1, 1847","But if Ma saw me with it, she might become angry."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Even Mrs. Fenton said that it was well-made.
c02,"May 1, 1847","But they must not have found any for they returned empty-handed, and roll call began."
c03,"June 1, 1847",Da had to get Ma and some of the other women to hold her so that Thomas could be taken above for burial.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Mrs. Coteau set me to work emptying shelves of pots and pans, scrubbing each shelf, washing, drying and polishing each pot and pan, and putting everything back exactly as it was."
c02,"May 1, 1847","St. Joseph himself is worn almost smooth from Da’s rubbing him with his thumb, but it has hung around Da’s neck for as long as I can remember.)"
c02,"May 1, 1847","Although he is scarcely older than Michael, he and a band he is with threatened and robbed some of the landlords."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I raised my hand and slapped her back.
c06,"September 1, 1847",But Mrs. Fenton remained unmoved.
c08,"November 4, 1847","Some fell on top of Mr. Hall too, pinning him to the ground and crushing the right side of his body."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I looked down at it.
c05,"August 1, 1847","It was only after the evening meal, which Mr. Johnson took but Mrs. Johnson did not, that Mrs. Coteau told me to fill some bowls with warm water and set them on the big table in the kitchen."
c06,"September 1, 1847","Even Fanny said so, but her mother silenced her with a cutting look."
c09,"December 1, 1847","“I would like to take you with me,” Mrs. Hall said."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mr. Webley turned to greet him.
c03,"June 1, 1847",She is terrified that he will get the fever.
c03,"June 1, 1847","On our ship, those who are well have divided into two groups."
c02,"May 1, 1847",That set Mrs. Tattersall to wailing.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Da and Michael must have been thinking the same thing, for they never spoke."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Sometimes we tell stories.
c05,"August 1, 1847",He wished me luck and left.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Meanwhile, people continue to fall ill, which causes more unrest and panic."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Lyons tells about the early days in this country.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I plunged it into the water and carried it to the person who had cried out.
c06,"September 1, 1847",I have started working on my quilt in my spare time.
c05,"August 1, 1847","“In my time here, I’ve met a lot of people from back home,” he said."
c05,"August 1, 1847",It was then that I heard the gentlemen mention the fever sheds.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mrs. Lyons had already put the pot on to boil.
c02,"May 1, 1847","He says that if we keep going, we will be on the steamer for Liverpool the day after tomorrow and on our way across the ocean soon after that."
c07,"October 2, 1847","A cow and two pigs were butchered, as was one of the oxen."
c02,"May 1, 1847",There is no fondness in her words now.
c04,"July 3, 1847",“They will look after you.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Fanny made up a song about packing that she and Lucy and I sang while we packed Lucy’s things.
c09,"December 1, 1847",It was Mr. and Mrs. Fenton and Fanny.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Some men, Da among them, have been helping the crew mend the rigging and the masts."
c05,"August 1, 1847","She laughs and giggles as soon as she sees him and runs to him, her chubby arms thrust up for him to catch her and hoist her above his head."
c03,"June 1, 1847","Later, Connor told me that he heard Mr. Kelleher say that he was sorry he ever left Ireland."
c05,"August 1, 1847","She makes sure I pay sharp
 attention to everything she does and warned me that I must be prepared to work hard, for there are six men expected for the next several days to help Mr. Hall build a barn for his team of oxen, his four cows, his six sheep with lambs, and his pigs."
c05,"August 1, 1847","As
 we walked, he told me his own story."
c06,"September 1, 1847",I am knitting a simple shawl while Mrs. Hall cuts down an old coat for me.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I was on my way up the stairs after mass with some linens this morning when I heard shouting in the front hall.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Mary Catherine, fifteen, was sent back when she fell ill. She is a thin little thing, all eyes and bones, and easily looks younger than her true age."
c09,"December 1, 1847","Mrs. Hall
 was quiet for the rest of the day."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Ma keeps looking up at the grey patch of sky above.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I am crouched behind a rock at the side of the road.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Between the rows there is a narrow aisle for bundles, boxes and chests."
c02,"May 1, 1847",It is frightening to think what would become of us if the ship were to strike something and sink.
c05,"August 1, 1847","At the very back of the house is a kitchen that is as large as the one at Mrs. Johnson’s house, but much sunnier, as it is not in the basement."
c02,"May 1, 1847",We passed many wretched-looking people who have nothing at all to eat.
c03,"June 1, 1847",We have had no news about Ma.
c02,"May 1, 1847","I will be happy if I never have to set foot on
 another steamer again."
c06,"September 1, 1847",She says things will go much more smoothly if we pull in the same harness like a pair of well-trained workhorses.
c08,"November 4, 1847","And right enough, when I looked outside, I saw a man in a sleigh turning off the road in the distance and making toward the house."
c06,"September 1, 1847","She likes to read, and has an aunt in Boston who is well married and has a fine library of books."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Then he insisted on pushing the cart back for me.
c02,"May 1, 1847","When I took out my book to write, Ma caught me at it."
c02,"May 1, 1847","Da said, with a wink, that it must make sure all the young men and young women are where they are supposed to be and not where they should not be."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I asked for pen and paper so that I might do it myself.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I caught the bit of metal in my hand and ran after him, determined not to let him slip away again."
c02,"May 1, 1847","Before we sailed, the captain ordered all the married men above deck."
c02,"May 1, 1847","You cannot walk more than two paces without being crashed into or having some beggar’s hand thrust out before you and a plea made, often by some poor soul from home."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Hall appeared at that moment and asked what the matter was.
c08,"November 4, 1847","I stifled a scream, for everyone knows that when a picture falls off the wall, it foretells a death."
c03,"June 1, 1847",He does not know if his ma is alive or dead.
c04,"July 3, 1847","While I was in the scullery with the pots, I heard Peggy outside, telling Mrs. Coteau about a new dress Mrs. Johnson was having made that she said was the latest fashion in London and that was to be trimmed with lace and beadwork."
c06,"September 1, 1847","I learned when I was small, but times got hard and we could not afford the wool."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I kept at it until I feared my arms would drop off.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Mrs. Keenan did not scold her.
c02,"May 1, 1847","With the dark came silence from every man, woman and child, and that seemed to encourage the wind, whose howls became battle cries as it first rocked and then shook the vessel."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall turned to me and asked if that was true.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Michael and I climbed the ladder after him.
c06,"September 1, 1847",She pulled out all the stitches and told me to start again.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I took it as anger that I had let him down and began to apologize at once.
c05,"August 1, 1847",She is so different from Mrs. Johnson that I can scarcely believe it.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Others ate dogs and grew fond of the taste.
c02,"May 1, 1847","She was as heavy as a cartload of potatoes when she fell on me, and I know I will be bruised all over."
c06,"September 1, 1847",This morning she sent me to the garden for vegetables.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I held the bit of metal up to his face and, though I gasped for breath, demanded to know where he had got it."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I was shocked and saddened to see that some lay dead and had not yet been removed from their bedmates who, in all truth, seemed indifferent."
c06,"September 1, 1847","She said there are many people who are angry that so many Irish have come to Canada, and that so many of them are ill and unable to look after themselves."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I didn’t know what the matter was or what to do.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I was hot and tired and hungry by the time we filed on board.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Da lay beside her and held her hand.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Ma held Patrick close and sang softly to him when she wasn’t fretting about how we would manage if the whole journey was as miserable.
c03,"June 1, 1847",The captain has ordered him locked up until we leave the ship tomorrow.
c06,"September 1, 1847","The result is very pleasing, especially when it is served with hot milk."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall said later that Mrs. Fenton has some prejudice against the Irish.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Change brings nothing but heartbreak and sorrow.
c04,"July 3, 1847",The houses are all of stone and have very steep roofs.
c05,"August 1, 1847","At least, I was glad right up until she said that she would be leaving in four days’ time to return to a place called Sherbrooke, which is several days’ journey southeast of Montreal."
c09,"December 1, 1847","But in reply to Lucy’s demands to see her father, Mrs.
 Hall said she must wait, for her father was sleeping."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mr. Fenton came before dark to take Mrs. Fenton and Fanny home.
c09,"December 1, 1847",But it was not.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I said I would be grateful.
c04,"July 3, 1847","She clutched a doll under one arm and watched me, feet firmly planted, for a few minutes."
c03,"June 1, 1847","On top of that, our Patrick is worse."
c02,"May 1, 1847",She woke up screaming.
c08,"November 4, 1847",The house is not the same without him.
c02,"May 1, 1847",There was only darkness quickly followed by the stench of sick and waste as buckets toppled and the awful shaking and shuddering roiled our stomachs.
c05,"August 1, 1847","That is why when Mrs. Hall asked me directly whether I would like to work for her, I hesitated."
c06,"September 1, 1847","Mrs. Hall says that with plenty of hard work, anyone can succeed in this country."
c02,"May 1, 1847",I wonder how Anna’s family managed.
c03,"June 1, 1847",He says the hardest thing for a mother is to lose a babe.
c04,"July 3, 1847",The boys are to sleep in another.
c02,"May 1, 1847",At first everyone made a grand effort.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Poor Lucy chafes for something to do.
c09,"December 1, 1847",I would stay with her until we were both able to begin our travels — she to her family across the ocean and I to mine inland.
c02,"May 1, 1847","The ship is large, but still I cannot see how it will fit so many people."
c06,"September 1, 1847","But when she
 finally came back out of the bedroom, Lucy claimed her attention, and the little bundle of mail stayed where she had left it on a bench near the front door."
c02,"May 1, 1847","Sizzling
 is such a fine word."
c08,"November 4, 1847","It can be the gold in the leprechaun’s pot.” I did not think this was a good idea, for it was clear the watch fob was of great value."
c09,"December 1, 1847","It is warm, and all the rows are even."
c03,"June 1, 1847","“Canada?” Michael asked, seeming dazed to see land at last."
c05,"August 1, 1847","The house is far from any town — it is a walk of several hours to get to Sherbrooke — or any neighbour other than the Fentons, but it is clean and bright and pretty."
c04,"July 3, 1847",So today I did what my head tells me was wrong but that my heart insists was right.
c07,"October 2, 1847",The meat all had to be stored.
c08,"November 4, 1847",He and Mr. Hall had been in an accident at the logging camp.
c01,"April 30, 1847","When Grandda told me all the stories he had about fairies and pookas and banshees, and about the ancients, such as the great Cuchulain, he said that stories hold a people together."
c09,"December 1, 1847","After packing, I took a last look at my room."
c05,"August 1, 1847","I am not ashamed at being sent away, for I know I did nothing wrong."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I did not sleep even a wink last night.
c06,"September 1, 1847","I had a picture of him and Daniel happily together and, although I know it is wrong, I was jealous."
c02,"May 1, 1847",They are not steamers.
c05,"August 1, 1847","He is a tall man, very handsome, with a trim moustache, soft brown eyes and an easy smile."
c07,"October 2, 1847",The poor little thing has been putting up such a fight.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I wonder if I look so deathly.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Fenton told us both that Mrs. Hall is in a nervous state.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Instead, I told her that I had heard the story from a woman who told it to her own daughter."
c05,"August 1, 1847",She deemed it cleaner and the food more palatable.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“You’re a 
thief
,” I said, scarcely believing the words even as I spoke them."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Now she makes little comments and corrections.
c08,"November 4, 1847",But she is feeling stronger and sits with us in the evening instead of retiring early.
c03,"June 1, 1847","He had thought that once the ill were removed from the ship, the rest of us would be free to go ashore."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Hall frowned.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Ma is inconsolable.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Connor’s father died two days ago.
c07,"October 2, 1847",I tucked the letter in the pocket of my dress and busied myself with my work.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mr. Hall was returning to camp when he saw two other men — Mr. Webley was one of them — piling logs.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Sailors went down below with long poles that had great spikes at the end.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Her father is in business and she is sure that he can find a position that is suitable for Mr. Hall that will not require much physical effort.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I looked down and saw that it was Daniel.
c07,"October 2, 1847","She sent me quietly
 to get Lucy dressed and dispatched me to get Mrs. Fenton."
c04,"July 3, 1847",He was gone.
c05,"August 1, 1847",God must truly love them.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Steamer
 is another fine word."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Older girls like me must earn their keep, of course."
c04,"July 3, 1847","She assured Connor that his brother was being well looked after and said, if he wished it, that she would send a message to the family to let them know that he would like to visit."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Or that something terrible had befallen Michael?
c05,"August 1, 1847",The doctor spoke with a tone of disdain.
c02,"May 1, 1847","“But never have I heard of a person’s mouth turning him into a girl, although in your case it clearly has."
c02,"May 1, 1847",There are two fireplaces on the deck for cooking.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Mrs. Johnson was to receive callers today.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Patrick was fretful all day when he wasn’t sleeping.
c08,"November 4, 1847",We are all wearing shawls and blankets over our clothes to keep warm.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I was too angry.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Would I ever find another employer as kind as Mrs. Hall?
c08,"November 4, 1847",She suggested we all have a cup of tea and sent Mrs. Lyons and me to the kitchen to prepare it.
c05,"August 1, 1847",She said that she did not know what was to become of her and her children.
c05,"August 1, 1847",But I am beginning to think that things are a misery for the least fortunate no matter where they may find themselves.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Lyons wept when she heard this.
c07,"October 2, 1847",But she confided in me that her true purpose was to visit me.
c01,"April 30, 1847","She says, how can we think of making a fresh start in a new land, Canada, when we have to rely on charity to get ourselves there?"
c03,"June 1, 1847","“That is called Cape Breton,” Da said, “from when the French were here."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Someone has offered to take me in, but I have refused."
c02,"May 1, 1847",There was no land in sight and no one to come to our rescue.
c04,"July 3, 1847",She went this morning to speak to one of the brothers who helps the older boys until they find employment.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Ma will not relinquish him for even one moment, even though Da offers to take him so that she can rest."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mrs. Fenton declared her intention to stay for as long as she was needed.
c09,"December 1, 1847","I’m sorry, Johanna."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Finally you boil the maize until it is soft.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Sister Marie-France sent for me late today.
c04,"July 3, 1847",It led down into a large whitewashed kitchen.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Thanks to the archbishop’s call for parishioners to take in or employ Irish orphans, Michael and some of the older boys had had little trouble finding employment — Michael with a carter."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Catherine is feeling better.
c03,"June 1, 1847","I was on deck again admiring the billowy clouds above, the rich green of the fields and forests, and the deep blue of the water when I had a terrible fright."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Fanny came today to give Catherine a wee cloth doll she had made.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Sister Marie-France let me go for a brief time after I helped with the laundry, but I might as well have stayed back."
c05,"August 1, 1847","I know that a girl alone in the world, as I am, needs respectable employment, which they will never obtain if they have a reputation for making trouble or for bad character."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Mrs. Coteau, the gardener and I ate when the Johnsons had finished."
c03,"June 1, 1847","Da had remarked more than once on the captain’s skill and his concern for his passengers, which, Da said, was not shown by every sea captain."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Another wanted water.
c02,"May 1, 1847","No matter, he says."
c04,"July 3, 1847",“Where is he now?” I asked.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Oh, what a sight!"
c03,"June 1, 1847","Ma is not among them, for which I am thankful."
c05,"August 1, 1847","But she only smiled and said that she understood, for she had seven brothers of her own and were she in my place, she would worry too."
c05,"August 1, 1847","If not, then she would interview another girl."
c04,"July 3, 1847","“You must pick up the linen,” she said sharply."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I think of Michael and wonder where he is.
c07,"October 2, 1847",And what of Uncle Liam?
c05,"August 1, 1847","She had been told, as I had, that everyone in Canada eats meat every day and that honey flows in abundance."
c05,"August 1, 1847",The room was silent.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I think she will grow up with superior airs just like her mother.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Mrs. Keenan is wearing herself out tending to them all.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I’ll see to Connor, and then I will find you.” A man wrestled Daniel from Connor and handed him to the same sister who had approached me."
c05,"August 1, 1847",A wagon came by after a while.
c08,"November 4, 1847","The sky was leaden all day, and there was something ominous in the air."
c03,"June 1, 1847",Ma held Patrick tightly.
c04,"July 3, 1847","He is quite handsome and, unlike his wife, he smiles easily."
c04,"July 3, 1847","He was skulking about outside one of the sheds, his eyes darting this way and that as he no doubt searched for what he could steal."
c04,"July 3, 1847",A glance at the poor wretches closest to me showed me that they lay in their own waste.
c05,"August 1, 1847",She listened to me without interruption.
c04,"July 3, 1847","The king promised that if the beautiful maiden spun a mound of flax into thread, made fabric from it and from that fashioned a shirt, the prince would marry her."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Mrs. Johnson immediately clapped her hands to shoo them away, saying that their poor father was too tired for such childish chaos."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Even Mrs. Hall and Mrs. Lyons sighed contentedly at the ending.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Hall asked me if this was true.
c09,"December 1, 1847",I was sitting on a sofa knitting when I heard a terrible crash.
c09,"December 1, 1847","She gently explained that I would have to wait until spring for the St. Lawrence to reopen before I would be able to travel by boat, and said she knew how hard it would be to wait, but that meanwhile I would be such a great help to her."
c05,"August 1, 1847","“Only those who deserve it.” He grinned at me again, sassy lad."
c06,"September 1, 1847",I took Lucy with me.
c08,"November 4, 1847",And with the wail of the banshee I had heard … Someone was going to die.
c08,"November 4, 1847","“Because I wanted you to love me for myself,” he replied, “and not for what I possess or how I look.” Lucy was pleased to learn that the two lived happily ever after and had two lovely daughters and two brave sons."
c06,"September 1, 1847",The barn is finished and the workmen have gone.
c05,"August 1, 1847","If I leave Montreal, how will I ever find out about Michael and my uncle?"
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Hall was so glad to see her that she hugged her.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Finally she knelt down before the child and made Lucy look into her eyes and swear to tell the truth.
c05,"August 1, 1847","On the way he asked me to tell my story, and I did, from the time we set sail, to my time at Mrs. Johnson’s, and my hope that Mrs. Hall would turn out to be a better employer."
c05,"August 1, 1847","The house has two storeys, with stone around the bottom to as high as my waist and then clapboard the rest of the way up."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall has a great bag filled with scrap pieces of fabric.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Then I told her what I had heard at the Johnsons and that Claire had heard Mr. Johnson say — that the newspaper reported every day the number who had died in the sheds.
c05,"August 1, 1847",She peered at me for a very long time and asked me if I understood the danger I might be in.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Perhaps her father had been asking for her.
c09,"December 1, 1847","He said that he would, and truly astonished me by grasping my hand and wishing me good luck and saying that he hoped I would be reunited with my brother."
c05,"August 1, 1847","It is easier still to drop a heated iron onto the ground, where it could fall upon (or, in my case, narrowly miss) the foot of some good sister who is going about her business."
c04,"July 3, 1847",She was not smiling.
c02,"May 1, 1847","From a distance, the stone piers and docks of Liverpool looked quite majestic, but close up they are crowded with people and ships, and the air is filled with shouts and cries, clatters and bangs."
c05,"August 1, 1847","I felt my face burn, but I could not lie to her."
c04,"July 3, 1847",How those two little words stabbed like daggers into my heart.
c07,"October 2, 1847","Apart from the heat of the tallow, candle-making is easy."
c04,"July 3, 1847","The sisters took us girls and small boys to a large house where they fed and bathed us and gave us clean
 clothes to wear."
c08,"November 4, 1847","Mrs. Lyons and I expected her to come back, but she did not."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I help Mrs. Hall prepare the morning meal.
c02,"May 1, 1847","One man swears he has seen coffins with trap doors in the bottom, which allow the coffin maker to sell and use the same coffin over and over."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Da said they were told to form a committee and that he was elected head of it.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I didn’t think.
c04,"July 3, 1847","She is well-dressed and has her hair pulled back and held in place with silver combs, and I am sure there are
 many who would call her elegant."
c04,"July 3, 1847","She knocked, and a voice called, “Enter.” A woman sat writing at a desk — Mrs. Johnson."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I almost collapsed then.
c05,"August 1, 1847",In the front sat a man and a woman I did not recognize.
c07,"October 2, 1847","“Johanna, is everything all right?” Mrs. Hall asked."
c06,"September 1, 1847","(Most of all, Anna wished for a gown made out of golden thread.)"
c05,"August 1, 1847","There is no chance of becoming dear and close friends who know each other like sisters, the way Anna and I did."
c03,"June 1, 1847","So when I saw a look in the captain’s eyes that seemed to me to be one of deep concern for Da, I felt a tremble go through me."
c09,"December 1, 1847","There he had met a boy, a cook’s helper."
c03,"June 1, 1847",Their mothers wept bitterly.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Kevin is poorly.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I do not believe a word of what she says.
c05,"August 1, 1847","“Let me do that,” said a soft voice behind me."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I guessed at once where Michael had gone.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I left the boy with his booty and stumbled back to the house, trying hard not to weep the whole way."
c09,"December 1, 1847",But it was not the Fentons.
c03,"June 1, 1847","But when he arrived, things did not turn out as I had imagined."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Fanny says this is why her mother finds every excuse to visit the Halls.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Did I not tell you to be quiet?” she hissed.
c08,"November 4, 1847","When she went to fetch it, she couldn’t seem to get it."
c08,"November 4, 1847","Mrs. Hall has been feeling poorly for the past two days, so when Mrs. Fenton came to visit yesterday, she decided to stay."
c07,"October 2, 1847","When my chores are done for the day, I sit with Mrs. Hall and work on my quilt."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Michael bent to him and laid a hand on his forehead.
c02,"May 1, 1847",He quoted the verse: “They reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wit’s end.” Michael is sick.
c05,"August 1, 1847","The second floor, which is smaller than the first, consists of three tidy little bedrooms, one of which is to be mine."
c05,"August 1, 1847",“Leave my presence.
c02,"May 1, 1847",He says his brother is probably busy with his animals and his crops.
c06,"September 1, 1847",I have started my very own quilt.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Sister Marie-France says that she will write to Uncle Liam, but she warns that she will not be able to keep me forever."
c02,"May 1, 1847","He tries to keep our spirits up, but Ma smothers his efforts and calls him a dreamer."
c02,"May 1, 1847",I am not afraid to go up on the deck anymore.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Eileen, who is thirteen, was sent back because she kept breaking things, for which she was beaten."
c04,"July 3, 1847","If he survived, Connor did not know what had become of him."
c07,"October 2, 1847","I stared at my name on the face of it for the longest time, unsure whether or not I wanted to open it."
c09,"December 1, 1847",It was as hard to say goodbye to her as it was to Anna.
c09,"December 1, 1847",I hurried into the parlour.
c05,"August 1, 1847",The house was fairly abuzz all afternoon with ladies coming and going.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Taking only my book, I left."
c05,"August 1, 1847","She asked me about myself and my family, seemed pleased to learn that I can both read and write, and, even though she is English, was sad to hear that all of my family save Michael perished with the fever."
c07,"October 2, 1847",The news was not the worst — there was no news of death.
c05,"August 1, 1847","“Now then,” she said when we were alone, “tell
 me what reservations you have.” I told her I had none."
c03,"June 1, 1847",I was afraid he would be sent away too.
c07,"October 2, 1847","But she says that although her mother is often angry, she is more often quite pleasant and that I must not mind her, as she is not as harsh as she seems."
c03,"June 1, 1847",The captain turned to Da.
c07,"October 2, 1847","Perhaps Michael had returned to Montreal and seen the notice that Mrs. Hall had put in the newspaper, or had spoken to Sister Marie-France."
c05,"August 1, 1847","I trotted after him, grateful for the assistance."
c06,"September 1, 1847",This time I cast on by myself and got it right.
c07,"October 2, 1847",The hides of the animals are to be sold.
c03,"June 1, 1847","I do the best I can: Uncle Liam says a moose is taller than a man, with antlers that are broader than the full span of a grown man’s arms."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mr. Fenton will keep an eye on the house and the farm until the Halls can return.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Why did Da not get this letter?
c02,"May 1, 1847",He tries to soothe Ma by reading Uncle Liam’s old letters aloud again.
c06,"September 1, 1847",For the past week he has been with the men raising the new barn.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Today would have been Patrick’s first birthday.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Catherine was buried today on a little hill under an oak tree behind the Halls’ house.
c04,"July 3, 1847",My head was spinning as I bent slowly to pick it up.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I later learned that I was right.
c08,"November 4, 1847",“We were playing —” I began.
c02,"May 1, 1847",There is so much groaning and vomiting below.
c07,"October 2, 1847",I play with Lucy while her mother attends to her own affairs.
c07,"October 2, 1847",She brought me the book about Mungo Park and said I might keep it as long as I like.
c05,"August 1, 1847",She sent word to the postmaster to be on the lookout for Michael and to tell him that his sister is alive and in Montreal.
c06,"September 1, 1847","He is making a small chest of drawers, which Mrs. Hall says is to be for my use."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I said I did.
c07,"October 2, 1847","Mrs. Hall is making long sturdy socks that Mr. Hall will wear when he goes about his winter work, which she says will consist mainly of working for the logging company."
c04,"July 3, 1847",They have three children.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Finally he turned and moved on to Michael, who was also passed, and then to Ma."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I have tucked them between the rope and the blanket of my little bed.
c05,"August 1, 1847","She sat in her rocking chair mending tea towels while she watched me wash one cup at a time, and then the same with the saucers and small plates."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Her commanding tone is more than I can bear in someone who is two whole years younger than I am.
c04,"July 3, 1847",What a commotion that caused!
c04,"July 3, 1847","I asked if he’d had word from Da, but he had not, although he said that he’d tried, much as I had."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Michael, Connor, Daniel and I were herded to another area where nuns and other women were waiting to gather the orphaned children."
c02,"May 1, 1847","She dreamt while they waited at Liverpool that she and her babies fell into the ocean and were swallowed up by waves, and that she had clawed her way through the cold water to try to catch them as they dropped like stones into the bottomless sea."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Along the outer walls of the shed were row upon row of rough-made beds, each containing two souls."
c09,"December 1, 1847","My dream was coming true, while hers had been dashed."
c05,"August 1, 1847",He also says that Uncle Liam wrote to his brother in Ireland last autumn and feared the worst when he received no reply.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I could not decide what to do.
c08,"November 4, 1847",“What on earth is going on?
c08,"November 4, 1847","Fanny says that ever after, her mother cautioned him to wear mittens while working with nails during winter."
c09,"December 1, 1847","His leg has been broken in many places, and his arm so badly crushed that it became infected and the doctor had had no choice but to amputate it."
c04,"July 3, 1847",But her eyes spoil the picture.
c05,"August 1, 1847",She says she wants to take her orders.
c05,"August 1, 1847","“They are lazy, ignorant creatures,” Mrs. Johnson replied, adding that she spoke from first-hand knowledge."
c07,"October 2, 1847",A man was trampled by a team of oxen.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Later I am glad that our names were called early, for the hold where we are to sleep is as gloomy as a November evening."
c08,"November 4, 1847",But I did not say a word to Mrs. Lyons for I did not think she would believe me.
c03,"June 1, 1847","“There must be some way we can find her if she gets well.” “You mean 
when
 she gets well,” I said sharply."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I had not thought of that.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Hanging my head, I turned to leave."
c06,"September 1, 1847","When she learned that Michael had left because he thought I was dead, she hugged me."
c06,"September 1, 1847","After the evening meal, Mrs. Hall asked me if I knew how to knit."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I have been left largely in the care of Mrs. Lyons these past days.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I begged Sister Marie-France for the employer’s name and asked where I could find him.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Mrs. Coteau had managed by using every vessel in the kitchen, praying that a replacement would appear before she herself would have to scrub the pots."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Anger flashed in Peggy’s eyes.
c07,"October 2, 1847","What
 if she had written with bad news?"
c07,"October 2, 1847",How I wished that my true place was with my brother and my uncle — with blood family.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Lucy runs to the door constantly to see if she can catch a glimpse of him.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I watched for her constantly and rushed to her when I saw her open the gate.
c02,"May 1, 1847",On some days we will get ship’s biscuit.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Sister Marie-France had died of the fever.
c08,"November 4, 1847",I had had no inkling.
c04,"July 3, 1847","He had come for Daniel and was in a great temper to find that he had been given away, as he put it, to a farm family."
c06,"September 1, 1847","Before I knew it, I didn’t feel shy anymore and was telling her everything — how first Patrick and then Ma had died, how Da had fallen ill on the way to Montreal, how I had learned of his passing, until finally all I had left was Michael."
c05,"August 1, 1847",“Like that medal?” he asked.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I stopped before I had gone two paces and held my hand to my nose, so foul was the stench."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I slipped away while I was supposed to have been at chores.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Da said that means there is a lighthouse keeper as well.
c02,"May 1, 1847","I lay in my place, curled like a frightened lamb and clutching the edge of the plank so as not to be tossed below."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Da tried to tease her out of her mood.
c05,"August 1, 1847","We did our best to give
 water and broth, when we had it, to the patients who are able to take them and, when we could, to move some of the worst-off patients onto clean bedding."
c03,"June 1, 1847",It was warm and she stirred.
c03,"June 1, 1847",She moaned as loud as the gale all night.
c08,"November 4, 1847",He had come to check that all was well in Mr. Hall’s absence and laughed to see me so obviously relieved.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I am not bothered at all.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“And when the prince learned that the first one had such large and ugly feet because she spun so much, and the second was so fat because she sat so long at the loom weaving the thread into fabric, and the third had an ugly and bloodied nose from being stuck so often with a needle while she tried to thread it, he vowed that his bride would never have
 to spin or weave or sew.” Peggy stared at me for a moment."
c09,"December 1, 1847","And she can cook!” Mrs. Lyons laid one hand on mine and smiled
 at me."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I rise to a room so cold that my breath hangs in a cloud above my head.
c08,"November 4, 1847","Mrs. Lyons also has stories about the Cree, stories that came to her from her grandmother, who heard them from 
her
 father, who was a fur trader."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Nearing and Mr. Webley.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Some moaned in agony or for release.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I have never been on a steamer before.
c05,"August 1, 1847","If they fuss, I tell them fairy stories in a whisper — the sisters do not approve of fairies — so that they will fall asleep."
c04,"July 3, 1847","He promised
 to send Michael to me."
c08,"November 4, 1847",She looked at her sobbing daughter.
c02,"May 1, 1847",And he went on and on about that coroner in County Waterford saying that so many deaths there were caused by “the negligence of the government” in not providing food to the people.
c02,"May 1, 1847","There has been much cleanup and repair to do, but everyone is in good spirits."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall looks at him the way Ma used to look at Da before things got bad.
c07,"October 2, 1847","I woke just as dawn broke, to a moan that put me in mind of the stories of banshees that Da used to tell when he wanted to make the hair on our heads stand up as straight as soldiers."
c05,"August 1, 1847","“I’ve a mind to call for a constable,” I said."
c02,"May 1, 1847",She says something may have happened to him.
c09,"December 1, 1847",I looked down at my feet and prepared myself for what was to come.
c08,"November 4, 1847","But Mrs. Hall said that she would love to hear one, so I launched into the tale of the vain princess who refuses all suitors as not being grand enough or handsome enough for her."
c04,"July 3, 1847",It was a nun.
c07,"October 2, 1847",It was the happiest day the house has seen in a long time.
c09,"December 1, 1847","Mr. Hall’s wounds are going to take a long time to mend, she said."
c08,"November 4, 1847","Lucy was restless today, and no wonder."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Mrs. Johnson employs another girl, Claire, who clearly believes herself above me in station."
c06,"September 1, 1847","It is hard, hot work."
c05,"August 1, 1847",What was she doing with it?
c07,"October 2, 1847","Before the whole household was awake, Mrs. Hall slipped Catherine into her bed."
c04,"July 3, 1847",One young lad called out for food.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I ate until I was stuffed.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Pierre says this is because it snows a lot in
 winter and the steep roofs let the snow slide off."
c03,"June 1, 1847","Later we passed into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where we saw whales!"
c05,"August 1, 1847","“I have a brother, but …” Tears stung my eyes."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Now that we are clean and clothed, I can see how hollow-eyed and pale everyone else is."
c04,"July 3, 1847",She said that some of the older boys were finding positions as apprentices and some girls were being put into service.
c09,"December 1, 1847","His right leg is badly damaged, and without his right arm, it is unlikely that he will be able to walk without assistance."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mr. Hall is very badly injured.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I soon discovered that they had come to gawk and to chatter idly about my poor countrymen.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Fanny and Mrs. Fenton returned today.
c05,"August 1, 1847","After the potatoes had blackened, his da went to work at road building in exchange for barely enough food for one person."
c03,"June 1, 1847",He held Ma all through the funeral.
c05,"August 1, 1847","I dried each
 one carefully, with much urging to be careful with each piece."
c06,"September 1, 1847","I was so nervous that my knitting got tighter and tighter, so that the square I was working on started to look like a triangle."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall said very quietly that she considered me a part of her family.
c06,"September 1, 1847",I was glad to be sent to the kitchen to help Mrs. Lyons get tea ready.
c04,"July 3, 1847","It was his St. Joseph, the patron saint of carpenters."
c08,"November 4, 1847","Later Mrs. Lyons told me that Mrs. Fenton was not a bad person, but that she is forgetful about her own past."
c04,"July 3, 1847","As I ran to her, I saw that she was lying on the ground with not even a sheet under her."
c02,"May 1, 1847","), and the ceiling is so low that the taller men can barely stand upright."
c03,"June 1, 1847","Da comforts her, but he has a faraway look in his eyes, and I imagine he is remembering Patrick."
c09,"December 1, 1847",He had seen Michael.
c06,"September 1, 1847",I was beside myself waiting for her to return to the parlour and go through the letters in case there was something among them from Sister Marie-France or even from Michael.
c04,"July 3, 1847","The littlest one, whose legs still wobble when he walks, is a boy named Matthew."
c04,"July 3, 1847","He — when I got close enough, I saw from the fuzz on his face that it was a young man — could not raise his head to drink."
c09,"December 1, 1847","As soon as Michael realized I was NOT dead, he travelled to Montreal, hoping that the nuns would know where I was."
c02,"May 1, 1847",I feel sorry for Da.
c04,"July 3, 1847",My heart raced at the sound of the voice.
c09,"December 1, 1847","He says he knows you, Johanna, and that you do not approve of him."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Sister Marie-France’s second letter had finally reached Uncle Liam.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“It’s a shame you cannot do the same, Johanna,” he said."
c03,"June 1, 1847",The doctor turned to the captain for help.
c05,"August 1, 1847","She had considered that, even though it would
 mean giving up her children, but without any references and with no one to guarantee her as the sisters did me, she has had no luck."
c05,"August 1, 1847","She seemed much nicer than the two women I overheard yesterday, and I was glad of the chance to earn my keep while I wait for word from Michael."
c06,"September 1, 1847",But there was nothing for me.
c01,"April 30, 1847",Da reminds her that his bother Liam is in Canada and will surely help us.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Then she fell silent.
c02,"May 1, 1847",We washed and aired the bedding and disposed of the waste.
c09,"December 1, 1847","Reassured but restless, he had gone back to Montreal to look for work."
c05,"August 1, 1847",It took a moment before I realized that she was speaking of me.
c05,"August 1, 1847","And does he now, like Michael, believe me dead?"
c05,"August 1, 1847",I climbed up and we were off.
c06,"September 1, 1847",I haven’t had to tear out any stitches for days.
c09,"December 1, 1847",She had received word a month ago that a favourite niece in Montreal was expecting and would welcome her help with the new baby.
c09,"December 1, 1847",She said that she had already spoken to Mrs. Hall.
c05,"August 1, 1847","It was late in the day when the wagon turned off at the roadside, where we spent the night at what Mrs. Fenton called a most disagreeable inn."
c04,"July 3, 1847",He almost managed.
c09,"December 1, 1847",In the evening he liked nothing better than to work on a new piece of furniture and decorate it with patterns he cut into the wood.
c06,"September 1, 1847",I know it.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Clearly I was mistaken and all was well with Mr. Hall.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Finally I offered to take her for a walk through town.
c04,"July 3, 1847","A woman had his hand, but he was tugging to get away from her."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I do not think that is right.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Sister Marie-France remained calm, although the flash in her eyes told me her patience was tested."
c06,"September 1, 1847","They dined today on beef and pork with vegetables from Mrs. Hall’s garden, a hearty pea soup, bread with butter, and tea with sugar."
c02,"May 1, 1847","Mrs. Keenan, the rude girl’s mother, offered to help me."
c04,"July 3, 1847","He is off to find Uncle Liam, whom he now takes to be his only living relative."
c03,"June 1, 1847","The doctor repeated his words sharply this time, as if Ma was wasting his time by not obeying him immediately."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Then I heard screaming.
c07,"October 2, 1847",It was from Sister Marie-France.
c03,"June 1, 1847",I have been telling them stories about what awaits us in Canada.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall continued to smile as she helped Lucy out of her boots and coat.
c04,"July 3, 1847",All each asked in return was to be invited to the wedding when the maiden married the prince.
c03,"June 1, 1847",I was so worried about Ma and afraid of what might happen to her that I cried until Michael lost patience and told me I must be strong.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Then, when Mrs. Hall returned and looked deep into my eyes and asked me if I was sure I wanted the position in her household, I said yes."
c04,"July 3, 1847",There are tables and floors.
c04,"July 3, 1847",He jumped to his feet and began to cram everything back into the blanket.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mrs. Hall agreed and said that she truly needed me.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Still more are ill. Da shook Michael and me awake this morning.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Her face grew even darker.
c04,"July 3, 1847",She offered to advertise for a position for me if that was what I wanted.
c05,"August 1, 1847","She wasted no time in saying no once more, but she was surprisingly gentle about it."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Sister Marie-France had received word from the couple who adopted Daniel — they said they would be pleased to have a visit from Connor.
c08,"November 4, 1847",She pulled harder and then let out a yowl.
c05,"August 1, 1847",How had she happened on it?
c07,"October 2, 1847",She will show me every step so that I will learn what she says is important for any woman to know.
c07,"October 2, 1847",How my hand trembled when he presented it to me!
c03,"June 1, 1847",Some say they will keep us on the ship for weeks.
c07,"October 2, 1847",What if she had learned that my uncle had died?
c01,"April 30, 1847",But how many Anna Riordans can there be?
c03,"June 1, 1847","“The poor man,” Da said, shaking his head."
c09,"December 1, 1847",“Then how did you find me?” I asked.
c05,"August 1, 1847",It does not help her case that she looks so ragged.
c05,"August 1, 1847","“I have no time to teach an ignorant girl,” she said."
c06,"September 1, 1847",She sat down in the kitchen with me while I cleaned the silver.
c03,"June 1, 1847","I did not see who he was whispering to, but ’twas easy enough to guess because a moment later wee Daniel, sound asleep, was handed into our berth and settled next to me."
c03,"June 1, 1847",Kerry wants to know about bears and wolves and other wild things with claws and fangs.
c03,"June 1, 1847","She does not speak, but goes silently about her chores."
c03,"June 1, 1847",Now I know.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Michael agreed with him immediately, saying that while the potatoes rot and common folk starve, the landlords have been selling oats, wheat, barley, beef and pork abroad."
c04,"July 3, 1847",He is a businessman.
c05,"August 1, 1847",How I wish that Ma and Da and Michael and Patrick and I were all together.
c08,"November 4, 1847","The logs fell on top of Mr. Webley, killing him almost at once."
c04,"July 3, 1847",There are dishes and pots and pans.
c04,"July 3, 1847","For dinner there was soup, meat, bread, vegetables, relishes, pickles and pudding — but no potatoes."
c07,"October 2, 1847","I will make it out of scraps, like my quilt."
c02,"May 1, 1847","As we waited to board, I heard someone say that there will be more than three hundred passengers."
c04,"July 3, 1847","“For fairies can be kind to those who are
 kind, but will punish those who are disrespectful or cruel.” She stared up at me for a very long time and then asked, “Are there fairies here?” I told her I did not know, and that was the truth of it."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Not I. I can read and write and do sums, thanks to Grandda, who was a schoolteacher in England before he came to Ireland and married Ma’s ma, and thanks to Ma, who was not ignorant either."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I also brought up the first pot of tea and the first pitcher of lemonade so that Mrs. Johnson could offer her guests refreshments.
c08,"November 4, 1847","He did not notice when one of the logs, then the rest, started to roll toward him."
c05,"August 1, 1847",One said that Irish girls are little savages who are hopeless with housework and have to be watched every moment.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I apologized as I skirted around her, but she grabbed my wrist and pressed her face close to mine."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Thoughts of my little book filled my head.
c04,"July 3, 1847",“Do you know about fallen angels?” Again she shook her head.
c05,"August 1, 1847",It is a wonder the wheels were not shaken off the wagon.
c07,"October 2, 1847","When I asked if her mother will be angry that she slipped away, Fanny said that she was sure to be."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Her da grabbed hold of it and jerked it down.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Mrs. Coteau herself set them on their shelves.
c02,"May 1, 1847","The hatches were closed, and all went dark."
c09,"December 1, 1847","As soon as it is finished, I will use the new book Fanny gave me to record my new life when it begins."
c04,"July 3, 1847",That is when I grabbed his arm.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Michael and I are minding Daniel.
c05,"August 1, 1847",The walls in the drawing room are painted yellow and the window frames black.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Daniel had been loaded into a wagon and was disappearing around a distant corner.
c05,"August 1, 1847","But no one stays
 for long."
c05,"August 1, 1847","In the evening, I help to settle the little ones."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Later I have been sitting by the window and weeping over these pages all night.
c08,"November 4, 1847",And all the trees — those without leaves and those that are always green — were frosted with snow.
c05,"August 1, 1847","I did not understand what he meant by that, so I asked one of the sisters."
c03,"June 1, 1847",The doctor was just as determined that she would not.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Mrs. Hall was busy putting Catherine down for a nap, so she set them aside without even looking at them."
c03,"June 1, 1847","Only later, at breakfast, did Michael tell me that Ma was still alive, but that Connor said she was so feverish that she was not in her right mind."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I couldn’t think.
c09,"December 1, 1847","Her tone was sombre when she said it was clear that they could not soon return to Sherbrooke and farming and, for that reason, she had to let one of us go."
c05,"August 1, 1847",She was holding a book that I recognized all too well.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Still I ran.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mrs. Lyons showed me how it is done.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Connor swears the doctor knew him for a boy, but for some reason let him be."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Poor Da.
c08,"November 4, 1847",She slapped me.
c07,"October 2, 1847","In addition to my regular chores, I have been helping to prepare for winter."
c04,"July 3, 1847",There are cups and measures and spoons and beaters.
c08,"November 4, 1847",She opened one of the drawers and brought back a gold chain with a small but solid-gold pendant at one end.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Here is what happened.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Leave at once.” My legs shook as I left the library clutching my precious book.
c04,"July 3, 1847","He spun around, his eyes wide at being caught."
c09,"December 1, 1847","She said she knew I would be a great help to Mrs. Hall, for I had learned a lot."
c02,"May 1, 1847","The berths
 are three high and are so close together that you can’t even sit up once you’ve slithered in."
c06,"September 1, 1847","The workmen are hungry, and they eat so much I can hardly believe it!"
c04,"July 3, 1847",But nowhere in their midst did I find Da.
c09,"December 1, 1847","Fanny hugged me again and said she hoped that I would write to her, and that she would write to me too and would count the days until I returned with the Halls."
c05,"August 1, 1847",She says she does not like to waste her precious time searching for items that have been misplaced.
c06,"September 1, 1847",I kept eyeing it and wondering if I should ask her about it.
c07,"October 2, 1847",But how I wished that the news had been different!
c04,"July 3, 1847",What did I care about breaking some silly rules?
c02,"May 1, 1847",Perhaps they were allowed two berths.
c04,"July 3, 1847","A man said he would be at the immigrant sheds, where there was a hospital."
c09,"December 1, 1847",I will have to think what to do once I have filled it up.
c08,"November 4, 1847","Indeed, I find it strange to be here without them."
c09,"December 1, 1847",It was Michael!
c04,"July 3, 1847",He closed his eyes and did not speak for a few minutes.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Too many are ill for such a ghoulish joke.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I thought of Noah and the great flood he had endured with his wee ark packed tight with all the creatures of the world.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Da was taken from us.
c09,"December 1, 1847",When I opened it I could hardly believe what I saw.
c04,"July 3, 1847",They are small and sharp and searching.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“As cold as the grave,” was his reply."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Connor said that he found a man who kept records of the patients, and that it was from this man that he learned that Da and Johanna Leary had died of the fever."
c02,"May 1, 1847","I hid it, thinking it worthless to anyone, for many of the pages are used and others are tattered."
c05,"August 1, 1847","I told her that I had had meat, milk and butter, but that I had not yet tasted the honey."
c04,"July 3, 1847",She was gone for the better part of the day.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I did not know what to say, so I asked her where she had heard such a thing."
c04,"July 3, 1847",He planned to go back to Grosse Isle once he had Daniel in hand and the money for travel.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Thief!” But by then he had disappeared around a corner.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Da would have danced him around the room.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Yet somehow my book had ended up in her possession.
c01,"April 30, 1847",I want to write about what is happening to us and what will happen next.
c09,"December 1, 1847","When Mrs. Hall returned I told her what had happened, and she rushed into his room."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Nellie’s eyes were wide when she asked if Lusmore had told him about the fairies.
c06,"September 1, 1847","I find that my stitches are different sizes, which does not look nice."
c09,"December 1, 1847","As soon as Lucy was in bed, Mrs. Hall asked to speak to me."
c02,"May 1, 1847",Michael scrambled from our berth to lend his hand to the task.
c08,"November 4, 1847",I am ashamed to say that I was relieved that the death that had been foretold was not Mr. Hall’s.
c04,"July 3, 1847",So I left those poor people crying out and ran to another shed in search of Ma.
c03,"June 1, 1847","My thoughts went to Ma, and I touched her hand."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Another humpback heard of Lusmore’s luck and asked him his secret.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I despise Mrs. Johnson.
c09,"December 1, 1847","The boy was Irish as well, so he and Connor became friendly."
c04,"July 3, 1847",She said that she would say a prayer for my da.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I feel glad for the little ones who are truly on their own.
c07,"October 2, 1847","But he came back alone, saying the doctor had been called away to an accident some 10 miles to the north."
c02,"May 1, 1847","When he turned to climb above, he motioned for Da to follow him."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Her gown, little more than a rag, was equally smelly, and she lay without so much as a piece of sheet to cover her."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Mrs. Lyons grabbed a shawl — as did I — and ran after her.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Ma has been helping with all the little Tattersalls so that Mrs. Tattersall could nurse Mr. Tattersall.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I do not know what we are supposed to do when the weather is not fine.
c05,"August 1, 1847","“I could have you arrested,” she screamed."
c05,"August 1, 1847","You get to know a girl one day, and the next she is off to a new home or a new position."
c03,"June 1, 1847","“And others who are healthy will fall ill. You will fall ill.” In the end, four of the captain’s men had to hold Connor, who fought like a wild thing to get free, while Kerry was taken from the ship."
c07,"October 2, 1847","I slipped out of my bed, wrapped a blanket around myself, and tiptoed downstairs."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Today I made 50 pounds of candles!
c02,"May 1, 1847",Da tries to keep our spirits up.
c04,"July 3, 1847","This sent Connor’s temper flaring again, for he did not want to 
visit
."
c08,"November 4, 1847","After the three years, there was a terrible drought, and all the crops failed."
c04,"July 3, 1847",It was not long before I saw a crowd of people headed in the same direction.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Men are needed to build a road for what Mr. Hall calls the winter sleigh haul.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Sister Marie-France appeared in the door of her office.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I realized then that she had slipped away.
c05,"August 1, 1847","After dinner when Mr. Johnson had gone to meet business acquaintances, Mrs. Coteau sent me to see Mrs. Johnson."
c05,"August 1, 1847","“What do you think would happen to other girls if ladies like
 Mrs. Johnson believed that they would all behave as you did?” she asked."
c03,"June 1, 1847","We are fewer than when we boarded, but Da says that those of us who are still standing must carry on."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Fanny taught me a song about sleigh-riding that she says is quite popular.
c04,"July 3, 1847",But clearly Mr. Johnson did not agree.
c04,"July 3, 1847",His face was grim when he looked up at me.
c03,"June 1, 1847",I wish we were in Canada.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Michael was afraid he would be discovered.
c08,"November 4, 1847",She asks constantly for her parents.
c02,"May 1, 1847","Ma did her best to calm them all while Da went above to tell the captain, who was down below in a trice with two crewmen to take Mr. Tattersall aloft."
c01,"April 30, 1847",I close my ears when Da tells me that I must not get my hopes up.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Disaster has struck!
c02,"May 1, 1847",Ma frets that Da has received no letter from Liam in nearly a year.
c07,"October 2, 1847","Mrs. Hall is also knitting warm stockings, mittens and a muffler for Lucy."
c04,"July 3, 1847",She agreed and promised to have the letter sent when I had finished.
c09,"December 1, 1847",I was shaking when I sat down again on the sofa.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Da was gone.
c03,"June 1, 1847",First there are those who have family members in the hospital.
c03,"June 1, 1847","“If only we had left last year, when Liam sent money to pay for decent passage."
c04,"July 3, 1847","If the roofs were flat, the snow would get very deep and the roofs might collapse."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I think too of Uncle and wonder what has become of him.
c08,"November 4, 1847",I bundled Lucy up and we went for a walk around the yard.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Nine more passengers have fallen ill and are being taken ashore.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I hated to see him leave after so short a visit, but there was nothing to be done
 about it."
c07,"October 2, 1847","Mrs. Lyons continues to make arrowroot gruel, which Mrs. Hall tries to feed her, usually without much success."
c09,"December 1, 1847","“Can you guess who I saw there?” I stared at him, hardly daring to hope."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Then Mrs. Johnson spoke to declare that the Irish are lazy, adding that she had read in the newspaper an account of their sloth."
c05,"August 1, 1847",She is so kind that I hugged her.
c02,"May 1, 1847",The wind howled as it tore at the vessel.
c07,"October 2, 1847",The other day I heard her singing softly.
c05,"August 1, 1847",He asked me if I was alone.
c08,"November 4, 1847","“Just as I have always suspected,” she said."
c05,"August 1, 1847","“You came here filthy, penniless, diseased, and yet I took you in,” Mrs. Johnson said."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I had to bite my tongue to keep from shouting.
c08,"November 4, 1847","To her great surprise, she falls in love with him."
c05,"August 1, 1847",The man it belonged to had already passed.” Tears sprang to my eyes at the thought of my da lying in that terrible place.
c02,"May 1, 1847","He told her to get her head
 out of the clouds."
c07,"October 2, 1847","But she is different, too, for Ma treated everyone with equal respect while Mrs. Fenton puts herself above some, such as me."
c04,"July 3, 1847","“The ship is leaving.” Then his eyes went to the sad figure on the ground before me, and a gasp escaped his lips."
c09,"December 1, 1847",I know how hard things have been for you.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I made my decision last night.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Michael did not correct himself.
c07,"October 2, 1847","When he returns, he plays quietly and wistfully with Lucy and then tucks her into her bed, which is now moved into the Halls’ bedroom."
c07,"October 2, 1847","Had he fallen ill, as Da had?"
c02,"May 1, 1847",Da says we are as snug as a family of wee swallows in their nest.
c09,"December 1, 1847",It was the Fentons who told him I was in Sherbrooke.
c08,"November 4, 1847",She refuses to kiss her own wed husband but instead puts him off with her haughty ways.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I was left to beat them as if they were the most wicked creatures on earth and it had fallen to me to punish them.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I was surprised how ravenous I was.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Her face turned scarlet and she slapped me on my face.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“From Peggy,” she said, meaning her sister, who is eleven and is like her mother in every way."
c04,"July 3, 1847",She would not let me go.
c04,"July 3, 1847","And, oh, the stench from the mouldering straw beneath him!"
c02,"May 1, 1847",Still too queasy to write.
c02,"May 1, 1847","But by
 midday, he was back in his berth, trembling like a nestling in a gale."
c05,"August 1, 1847","The kitchen windows, small and set high in the foundation wall, were all open so that we might have some air."
c09,"December 1, 1847",It had come from the sick room.
c05,"August 1, 1847",But never ignorant.
c05,"August 1, 1847",Two of the sisters go each day to the fever sheds to care for the sick and the dying.
c01,"April 30, 1847","When we leave, all the sadness and misery around us will vanish."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Michael was alive and well.
c03,"June 1, 1847","The captain has told Da he will do his best to find out how she is, but he warns that this may not be easy."
c04,"July 3, 1847",One of the women scooped up Daniel.
c09,"December 1, 1847",They had received word from Mrs. Hall.
c09,"December 1, 1847",They are the first pieces of furniture I’ve ever had to myself.
c06,"September 1, 1847","I am so grateful for my
 little room."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Today was baking day.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Someone let out a shout behind me, but I did not even turn to see who it was."
c02,"May 1, 1847","I hate when he calls me that, as if I’m a mere
 child."
c08,"November 4, 1847","The first bolted out of the way, but Mr. Webley did not understand what the problem was."
c07,"October 2, 1847","Indeed, it was no news at all."
c09,"December 1, 1847","He was hired on by the boss of a logging camp, although not the same one that had employed Mr. Hall."
c07,"October 2, 1847","She bought molds for them while she was in Montreal, which she says make the job much easier than having to dip each candle in the hot tallow, then cool it, then
 dip it again and again to get it to the right thickness."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I am not surprised.” Then she added, “Mother says that Irish are lazy.” I was stung, but determined not to show it."
c03,"June 1, 1847","For my part, I cannot wait to get off this ship."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Mrs. Coteau says I have got off to a bad start because she had to shake me awake this morning.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Then he set out to find me.
c04,"July 3, 1847",We were all he had now.
c09,"December 1, 1847","Mr. Fenton did not stay, for he wanted to return home before dark."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Ma would have fussed over him.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I had no choice.
c05,"August 1, 1847",That was true enough.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mrs. Fenton said that the Halls are not going to return home immediately.
c06,"September 1, 1847","When I said I had, she asked so many questions about my family and my life back home that it made me quite melancholy."
c09,"December 1, 1847",It was Connor!
c05,"August 1, 1847","And sometimes, late in the night, I awaken with an ache in my heart for Ma and Da."
c09,"December 1, 1847",But what would become of me when she left?
c06,"September 1, 1847",The rest had to be dried.
c02,"May 1, 1847",She is very nice.
c07,"October 2, 1847",The doctor has come again and has again prescribed warm baths.
c04,"July 3, 1847","For my part, I cannot believe that one household can consume so much food!"
c09,"December 1, 1847",Fanny was here!
c04,"July 3, 1847","He surprised me with a kiss on the cheek before he left, and said he did not blame me for what had happened to Daniel."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Because of this she has forbidden any noise.
c08,"November 4, 1847","He tore the skin getting it off, and Mrs. Fenton had to bandage it."
c02,"May 1, 1847",She picked herself up as if she had tripped over a rock and started off again without so much as asking if I was hurt.
c09,"December 1, 1847","I tried to tell him that I just wanted to mop up the water and pick up the pieces of broken jug, but he wouldn’t hear of it."
c02,"May 1, 1847",What if the ship did not hold?
c02,"May 1, 1847","But instead of being allowed to settle ourselves, we were held at one end of the ship in a great crush."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Mrs. Fenton did not lower her voice when she told Fanny that she should stay clear of me because I was one of “those Irish” who were spreading disease all over the city.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Fanny protested, but her mother’s voice was sharp."
c06,"September 1, 1847",She demanded that I address her as Miss Fanny and said that it was presumptuous of me — those were her exact words — to speak to Fanny as if she were my equal.
c04,"July 3, 1847","But when we set down on Grosse Isle and the first mate denied him permission to visit Kerry in the hospital, Connor tried to break free again."
c04,"July 3, 1847","For a moment he seemed unable to move, just stared at her."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Then you pour hot tallow into the mold and set it aside to cool.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Mr. Hall was never idle.
c03,"June 1, 1847","He died so quietly, poor wee thing."
c05,"August 1, 1847",She did not say a word.
c07,"October 2, 1847",The little boy was five and the little girl was three.
c08,"November 4, 1847","He looked weary as he said, “There was an accident.” Mrs. Hall moaned and reached for the blanket-wrapped bundle, which, I now saw, was as big as a man."
c09,"December 1, 1847",A quiet day.
c03,"June 1, 1847","We passed another island, which the captain called St. Paul Island."
c05,"August 1, 1847","When I heard that, all the gladness flew from my heart."
c08,"November 4, 1847","As first she looked merely puzzled, wondering no doubt about the identity of the visitor."
c04,"July 3, 1847",In the end I had to agree to let her look into the matter.
c09,"December 1, 1847",And all this time I had thought I might never see her again.
c04,"July 3, 1847",It was Michael.
c07,"October 2, 1847",But what if it was good news?
c02,"May 1, 1847","Chests and boxes had cascaded to the floor of the hold and had to be secured so that they did not smash or, worse, damage the hull."
c06,"September 1, 1847","She came today and, as is usual, Fanny came with her."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Mrs. Fenton sniffed the air when I was introduced, as if she expected to smell some unpleasant odour lingering on me."
c08,"November 4, 1847","I didn’t want to lie to her, but neither did I want Lucy to take the blame for something that was an accident."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I told her what the letter said.
c04,"July 3, 1847",We were all each of us had.
c09,"December 1, 1847","He was so pale and thin, and the right sleeve of his shirt hung empty."
c08,"November 4, 1847",Lucy began to cry.
c03,"June 1, 1847","By the time the inspector reached our bedraggled little row, fully one third of the passengers in front of us had been taken aside for transport to the hospital."
c07,"October 2, 1847",The air turns cooler every day.
c07,"October 2, 1847",I heard Mrs. Hall crying.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I climbed the ladder to peek at them.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Mrs. Hall supervises Mrs. Lyons and me, but she also works hard herself."
c08,"November 4, 1847","“A year which, she never omits to mention, was no fault of their own."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I said that I was and that I had come to Canada for the same reason she had.
c09,"December 1, 1847",He’s living on a farm with Uncle Liam.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Connor was on her in an instant, yelling as he pulled his brother away."
c07,"October 2, 1847","Whatever the news, it would not change because I was afraid to read it."
c02,"May 1, 1847","When I told her, all she said was that she hoped it would not turn out to be a book of sorrows."
c05,"August 1, 1847",A red welt the size of my hand appeared on her cheek.
c04,"July 3, 1847","As he gulped at the water, others around him cried out."
c08,"November 4, 1847",At that Lucy jumped up and ran to the little desk that Mrs. Hall uses to write letters to her family.
c02,"May 1, 1847",There are always women crowded near the fireplaces.
c02,"May 1, 1847","This morning as I made my way above deck to cook the breakfast, I heard Mrs. Tattersall whisper to Ma that Mr. Tattersall is feeling poorly."
c04,"July 3, 1847","At the same time, the boy — for it turned out that it was a boy not much older than I — dropped the bundle he was carrying."
c03,"June 1, 1847",Uncle Liam says the air is clean and clear there.
c02,"May 1, 1847",She says that if it collapses — and she seems certain it will — at least we will not be crushed.
c02,"May 1, 1847",Mrs. Keenan said that she wished Mr. Keenan would learn to mend for it would make her work lighter.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I think she would have scolded me but for my bursting into tears.
c05,"August 1, 1847",She told me that I might sit at the very back of the wagon.
c07,"October 2, 1847","Mrs. Fenton disappeared into Mrs. Hall’s room, while Fanny did her best to amuse Lucy."
c07,"October 2, 1847","First you thread the wick, which comes in a ball, through the mold and tie it at the bottom."
c07,"October 2, 1847","I know because I woke up twice and each time I heard her directly below me, singing softly while the rocking chair creaked."
c09,"December 1, 1847","I was about to go to the room I shared with Lucy at the back of the house when Mrs. Hall said, “You have a visitor, Johanna.” No wonder she was smiling."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Mrs. Coteau watched me.
c06,"September 1, 1847","I am confident that she would change her opinion of you if she knew you as I do.” For myself, I do not share that confidence."
c07,"October 2, 1847","Since her sister’s passing, Lucy refuses to sleep in her own room."
c04,"July 3, 1847","He wanted his brother 
back
."
c06,"September 1, 1847","And when, despite my best intentions, I cried for fear that I would never see him again, she hugged me even more tightly."
c04,"July 3, 1847","The journey up the river took two long days and nights, with all of us jammed together on the deck of a steamship like so many pieces of wood."
c01,"April 30, 1847","I wonder what he would think if he were still here, for Da says that this great trouble we are in is tearing our people apart."
c09,"December 1, 1847","It was the first time Mr. Fenton has said anything to me, for he is a quiet man."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I promised that I would, but said I had something important to do first."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Fanny is fun to talk to.
c05,"August 1, 1847","When I am not at the sheds, I help the sisters with new young arrivals from the ships who either reach Montreal as orphans or whose parents are too ill to care for them."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Continuing with the farm is not going to be possible.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Mrs. Fenton and Fanny came to visit together with Fanny’s elder sister Elizabeth, who married last year and is on her way to meet her husband in Montreal."
c07,"October 2, 1847",I sweep and wash and scrub.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I didn’t think about what I was doing.
c09,"December 1, 1847",She seemed to be watching for someone.
c06,"September 1, 1847",I hid my disappointment and cried when I was in bed.
c08,"November 4, 1847",Even Mrs. Hall joins in with stories of some of the English kings.
c04,"July 3, 1847","She said if I would come with her, she would see me washed and dressed and fed."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I am not an orphan.
c05,"August 1, 1847",But it was like trying to build a very long wall one small pebble at a time.
c02,"May 1, 1847",His passing was discovered this morning when Mrs. Tattersall woke to find him cold beside her.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Despite the discomfort, I fell asleep on my feet and did not wake until someone jostled me."
c05,"August 1, 1847","In the back was a third, older girl."
c05,"August 1, 1847","In addition there are several storerooms where Mrs. Hall keeps trunks and boxes and Mr. Hall keeps scraps of wood, boxes of nails, and other carpentry supplies."
c04,"July 3, 1847",My da is alive.
c05,"August 1, 1847","People will not hire them even though they are in need of workers, and then they condemn the poor wretches for begging or for threatening to become a drain on the city’s resources."
c07,"October 2, 1847","I am using the colours of the autumn
 leaves before they fell — flame red, rich gold and bright orange."
c04,"July 3, 1847","“Nonsense,” he declared, gathering Matthew and Nellie, who is seven, into his arms and carrying them up the stairs, trailed by Peggy, the eldest."
c05,"August 1, 1847",It seems that we are regarded with more critical eyes and are quizzed as to what chores we did at home.
c05,"August 1, 1847","He gave the food to his family, but it wasn’t enough."
c05,"August 1, 1847","“It was lying on the ground, I swear it."
c06,"September 1, 1847",Mrs. Lyons was right.
c08,"November 4, 1847",I knew it in my heart.
c06,"September 1, 1847",She seems nice and I enjoy her happy chatter.
c07,"October 2, 1847",I have been so busy.
c05,"August 1, 1847","When I had finished, she said, “And now you are sure?” I explained that Sister Marie-France had promised to write again to the postmaster in Bytown to tell him where I could be found."
c09,"December 1, 1847",I ran to him and hugged him.
c09,"December 1, 1847",The news of Michael had been like a bright summer sun.
c06,"September 1, 1847",It is a thrilling story.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I dried my hands and opened the kitchen door, and was surprised to find Mrs. Johnson standing right there in the hall."
c04,"July 3, 1847",It was then that he chose to run.
c06,"September 1, 1847","It looks easy when she does it, but I have to concentrate very hard to make mine look as perfect as hers."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Was I doomed forever to be a kinless stranger in this country?
c07,"October 2, 1847","The fever has carried Catherine off, poor little thing."
c05,"August 1, 1847",He sold his land in the Gatineau Hills only a month ago and moved to where the land is even better.
c05,"August 1, 1847","Just today I was in the scullery, dreaming of the delicious cakes and cream that Mrs. Coteau had made for company and wondering if any of them would return to the kitchen, even half-eaten, so that I might try one, when I heard voices."
c03,"June 1, 1847",But there is some confusion about the other names and so Connor is worried.
c07,"October 2, 1847","When my knitting improves, I will make her some warm socks for winter."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mr. Hall is out of the house from dawn to dark.
c08,"November 4, 1847","To give her greater pleasure, I acted out the parts."
c02,"May 1, 1847",We had to wait for such a long time before boarding that my legs got weary from standing.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I thought how sad it was that my ma, who was much prettier and much sweeter than Mrs. Johnson, never had so fine a dress."
c03,"June 1, 1847","While he was there, he looked for ours as well."
c04,"July 3, 1847",But he swore to me that he had seen Michael only yesterday and that he was greatly saddened because he had learned that both Da and I had died.
c05,"August 1, 1847",He seems as eager as she is and happily obliges her.
c08,"November 4, 1847","Mr. Fenton, who dropped by yesterday, said that he doesn’t remember such cold so early in the season."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I continued with the story, and she listened raptly despite herself as I described one old woman who appeared to spin the flax into thread, a second who made cloth of it, and a third who made a shirt of the cloth."
c02,"May 1, 1847","I haven’t seen the rude girl in days, and just as well."
c03,"June 1, 1847","Immediately afterward, the hatches were battened again."
c04,"July 3, 1847",But Connor did not know.
c03,"June 1, 1847",I heard Mr. Kelleher tell Ma that she is feverish.
c09,"December 1, 1847",I had tears in my eyes when I thanked her.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Late this afternoon, while I was washing and scraping vegetables at the kitchen door, Peggy Johnson appeared, unnoticed by me until she demanded that I tell her a fairy story."
c05,"August 1, 1847","I have been so busy, there has been no time to write."
c04,"July 3, 1847","Mrs. Coteau bustled about, taking the bread dough, which she had set to rise during the night, out to a small bread oven behind the house."
c06,"September 1, 1847","Mrs. Hall used to have a woman come in to help her, but now she is teaching me."
c08,"November 4, 1847",I confess that I panicked.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Tears trickled down my cheeks as I watched her drive away with her parents.
c04,"July 3, 1847","I ran until I thought I would run the feet right off my ankles, and as I am taller than he and my legs are longer, I finally caught hold of him once more and this time I held tighter."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mrs. Hall stood on the hill all day until Mr. Hall went to fetch her back to the house.
c03,"June 1, 1847","The captain,
 for his part, always addressed Da as Mr. Leary and never condescended to him."
c04,"July 3, 1847",Grandda’s words have been in my head all afternoon and evening.
c07,"October 2, 1847","Not only does she love to sing, but she has a beautiful voice!"
c02,"May 1, 1847",All of them chatter and gossip.
c09,"December 1, 1847","I was almost in tears, torn between the kindness they both showed to me and the loss of Mrs. Lyons, who has been such a good friend."
c09,"December 1, 1847",So did Lucy.
c07,"October 2, 1847",My heart sank.
c03,"June 1, 1847",What if … I don’t even want to write the words.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Mrs. Kelleher has died, and I am worried about Ma."
c07,"October 2, 1847",Catherine is fevered again and unable to keep anything in her stomach.
c03,"June 1, 1847","To make matters worse, a storm started to blow just as the service was being read for the dead — four in all, including Connor’s da and sister."
c06,"September 1, 1847","Mrs. Fenton criticized my work, saying I was allowing them to be too noisy."
c05,"August 1, 1847","Her face was stern when she told me that Mrs. Johnson had paid a visit for the express purpose of
 lodging a complaint against me."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Mrs. Lyons says that these men will be very hungry and must be fed good wholesome food.
c08,"November 4, 1847","“I think maybe the new child will make things easier
 on her.” “New child?” It took me a minute to understand that a new babe was on its way."
c05,"August 1, 1847","I removed the apron I was wearing, folded it, and calmly set it on my cot."
c05,"August 1, 1847","When I assured her that ’twas nothing but Christian charity, her eyes widened."
c02,"May 1, 1847","I wish I had a potato now, with a little salt and a little milk."
c08,"November 4, 1847","Nearing said he would call back for Mrs. Hall after he visited Mrs. Webley, and would take her to Sherbrooke."
c05,"August 1, 1847",Sister Marie-France’s sad and sombre eyes dashed my hope to smithereens.
c03,"June 1, 1847","As he peered at her I noticed, as if for the first time, how thin and frail she was in contrast to the sturdy doctor."
c03,"June 1, 1847",I decided to say a special prayer for her every night.
c09,"December 1, 1847","She promised to help me find another position in the area before she leaves, and to write me a good reference."
c04,"July 3, 1847",I slipped away again for an hour after I saw Sister Marie-France leave the house.
c04,"July 3, 1847",But when he saw it was me he laughed and twisted loose of my grasp as easily as you please.
c05,"August 1, 1847","“The wretched souls who survived the ocean voyage are now dying in droves.” To which Mrs. Johnson replied, “Their landlords should be ashamed of themselves for shovelling their problem onto our shores to be cared for by our charity.” I knew for myself that the sheds were filled with many decent people who had never needed any
 charity until they were forced to watch their loved ones die of hunger."
c04,"July 3, 1847","After he had gone, I begged Sister Marie-France to let me search for Michael."
c03,"June 1, 1847",Kevin keeps asking me to describe a moose to him.
c04,"July 3, 1847","There is the kitchen, the hall, porch, the stoop, the stairs."
c05,"August 1, 1847","She had tried to find employment, but there was nothing save the prospect of going into service."
c03,"June 1, 1847","But if there is anyone else living on the island, they stayed well hidden."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I asked him to describe the owner, but he could not."
c04,"July 3, 1847","“Some people say that fairies are fallen angels,” I said."
c08,"November 4, 1847",He was given land and three years’ supply of food by the Crown.
c02,"May 1, 1847","We saw three sailors sitting in a row with their legs straight out in front of them, mending sails."
c02,"May 1, 1847",I don’t know how she could have raised such an unpleasant daughter.
c06,"September 1, 1847",Then you have to drain them and dry them before the fire until the skin starts to split.
c04,"July 3, 1847",Too late.
c06,"September 1, 1847","It is much harder work even than at Mrs. Johnson’s, but Mrs. Lyons is much gentler than Mrs. Coteau, although she does seem particular about how she likes things done."
c05,"August 1, 1847",How dare you write these things about me!
c04,"July 3, 1847",Then Peggy told Mrs. Coteau something she had heard her mother read to her father from the newspaper.
c06,"September 1, 1847","Fanny started by showing me different trees and plants and telling me their names, but soon we started talking about other things."
c08,"November 4, 1847",I was so angry at the slanders that my voice trembled when I told her that I would never steal from the Halls and that we were merely playing.
c09,"December 1, 1847",Then she caught sight of us and waved for us to hurry.
c02,"May 1, 1847",I think that anything that sizzles must taste delicious.
c04,"July 3, 1847",I went in search of someone in authority.
c05,"August 1, 1847","The other two rooms are for the cook, Mrs. Lyons, and a man that Mr. Hall hopes
 to be able to hire for at least part of next year."
c05,"August 1, 1847","“You’re the 
thief
,” I said."
c09,"December 1, 1847",Then Fanny reached into her pocket and brought out a little package for me.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I put my arm around a girl no older than myself to help her drink some water.
c08,"November 4, 1847","Someone 
had
 died."
c02,"May 1, 1847","Da went to her and told her calmly but firmly she mustn’t carry on so, as it set a poor example for the children."
c08,"November 4, 1847","Mr. Hall is in Sherbrooke, alive but badly hurt."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I looked about, but saw no nurse or doctor or indeed anyone who might answer the cry."
c05,"August 1, 1847",All the while I ache for news of Michael.
c09,"December 1, 1847",She has not said anything about her conversation with the doctor yesterday.
c08,"November 4, 1847","He also says that many of the men are new to timbering and that, because of this, there are many accidents."
c04,"July 3, 1847","One whole day it rained, drenching us to our skins."
c06,"September 1, 1847","I think she must have sensed that, for she changed her tack and said that she would take me walking one afternoon when Mrs. Hall could spare me, to acquaint me with the countryside."
c05,"August 1, 1847",But most who find themselves here are either ill or destitute through no fault of their own and have been reduced to beggary.
c08,"November 4, 1847",He took me to the veranda to show me that the snow was so high only on the north side of the house where the kitchen is and on the north side of the barn.
c03,"June 1, 1847",Connor had gone ashore to look for his ma.
c02,"May 1, 1847",She said we can afford it as we have barely touched the week’s rations.
c07,"October 2, 1847",Mr. Hall nodded his agreement.
c04,"July 3, 1847","Cleaning, cleaning, cleaning."
c08,"November 4, 1847",I ran to get Mrs. Hall and found her at the window in the front room.
c05,"August 1, 1847",But there are so many things in this kitchen — a hundredfold and more than were ever in our own home.
c03,"June 1, 1847","We spent two days wishing for the doctor to come and inspect us, and all the while I was impatient to get off the ship."
c04,"July 3, 1847","I ran to him and threw myself at him, never minding the fence that stood as high as my waist between us."
c09,"December 1, 1847","“He likes to say he’s an honest man,” Connor told me, “even though he got his start in this country as a thief."
c01,"April 30, 1847",He says that the Irish in America are scattered like the stars across the sky and that any one of them will be hard to find.
c03,"June 1, 1847","But we are in Canada, and from the ship can see hills and woods and neat little farmhouses at the river’s edge."
c05,"August 1, 1847",The postmaster knows the general area where Uncle Liam has gone and has written to another postmaster to find out for sure where he is.
c04,"July 3, 1847","No matter what I did — washing, scrubbing pots, preparing vegetables — she grumbled at me."
c05,"August 1, 1847",I wonder if Anna has made new friends.
c06,"September 1, 1847","After that, I knitted a few inches."
c04,"July 3, 1847",It was only when I saw him pick up a second Bible that it occurred to me what he was up to.
c07,"October 2, 1847",She has more in common with my own ma than I had imagined.
c02,"May 1, 1847",My feet will point at her head the whole way to Canada.
c09,"December 1, 1847",I brought out my package and presented it to her.
c05,"August 1, 1847",He delights in his small daughters and Lucy clearly dotes on him.
c03,"June 1, 1847","Mr. Keenan, Connor’s da, is ill with the fever."
c05,"August 1, 1847","The sister in charge of the laundry said that we all learn best from our mistakes, but I can tell she does not relish having to report the loss of an otherwise perfectly good piece of linen."
c03,"June 1, 1847","Because we have had the fever on board, those who are unwell will be sent to a hospital on the island called Grosse Isle, which lies just off Quebec."
c09,"December 1, 1847","“Oh no,” I said."
c06,"September 1, 1847","She is always sending books to Fanny, and Fanny always tells me about the latest one she is reading."
c05,"August 1, 1847",She would not let me begin to wash such fine china while she was too busy to supervise me.
c05,"August 1, 1847",How dare you presume to judge me!” My mouth gaped.
c05,"August 1, 1847",I also busy myself with laundry and scrubbing.
c04,"July 3, 1847","“I heard you 
died
,” he said."
