6,le 5 octobre 1666,"I was not an indentured servant or a slave, but her niece, and in a manner, her apprentice."
13,le 2 mai 1667,"I said nothing to Tante Barbe, for my thoughts were on what I must do."
3,le 14 juillet 1666,How I would have loved to dance as well.
5,le 20 septembre 1666,“Get out!” And she ran from my sight.

4,le 4 août 1666,"I nearly burst into tears, but I would not let him see my weakness."
5,le 23 septembre 1666,"“Mademoiselle St. Onge is a fille à marier , I remind you.” Monsieur Aubry leaned on his musket and hesitated."

9,le 31 janvier 1667,Kateri cried out.
5,le 16 septembre 1666,"When I told Kateri this, her eyes grew wide and she excused herself."
4,le 30 août 1666,I have no idea what lies in my future.

1,le 26 mai 1666,I have sinned.

6,le 4 octobre 1666,Tante Barbe patted my hand.
5,le 6 septembre 1666,"The King needs his young women to marry and bear children so that New France will be peopled.” I scarcely knew how to answer except to mumble that yes, I would consider it."

6,le 4 octobre 1666,Take your time.
4,le 7 août 1666,Perhaps you
4,may,I think it will storm.
9,le 6 janvier,Monsieur Aubry regarded me with the saddest expression.
10,le 2 février 1667,"Its curved front ploughs through the snow, and a man can pull heavy loads on it."
12,le 1 avril 1667,"Until then, I content myself with the smell of the bread I baked today."
4,le 4 août 1666,Therefore you distress me.” There was a fierceness in his tone that made Monsieur Deschamps step back.
6,may,“What of Madame Moitié?” Kateri asked.

10,le 12 février 1667,He heard the news from a Mohawk who came here to trade.
2,le 17 juin 1666,"They are of all sizes and shapes, some as young as I am, but most at least as old as Catherine, it appears."

2,may,Marie with the missing front tooth proudly showed me the small chest provided for each of the girls by the King.
3,le 9 juillet 1666,I do not want to die here.
4,le 28 août 1666,"“Is it charity for you to help me find my relative, Madame Moitié?"

6,le 25 octobre 1666,Monsieur Deschamps appeared shortly after.
8,le 7 decembre 1666,I have all of my teeth and I intend to keep them.
8,le 20 decembre 1666,"Tante Barbe leaned over, looked and nodded."
13,le 2 mai 1667,"She said the warriors suspected who I was, since Jean had described me to them many times."

2,le 17 juin 1666,It is easier to remember who they are by how they look.
9,le 31 janvier 1667,"If Kateri went out, then others might catch the smallpox from her."
6,le 5 octobre 1666,Each of those two rooms has four beds in it and last night the house was full.
10,le 2 février 1667,"Monsieur Aubry arrived at our door today, towing Kateri on a traine , which is a sled they make here out of birch."
10,le 14 février 1667,"Only practice will perfect my aim, and I will practise under his supervision as often as possible."
6,le 4 octobre 1666,"Later, when you feel as though you can, you will tell me how it is that you have come here on your own.” Then she hurried off, calling orders to the girl who helps her."

7,le 24 novembre 1666,He wiped his dripping nose upon his sleeve.

10,le 17 février 1667,It is so cold here that it takes a great amount of wood to keep a room warm.

10,le 4 février 1667,Food is all I think of some days.

9,le 6 janvier,He smiled crookedly.

6,le 8 octobre 1666,"Tante Barbe took him on as an engagé , saying that she needs the help of a strong young man."
6,le 2 octobre 1666,"They will travel with us up river, they say.” The Mohawks wear only breechcloths."
2,le 26 juin 1666,"If they were on the deck, they would probably consider it inappropriate that I speak with Séraphin."
10,le 22 février 1667,It is not.
2,le 7 juin 1666,I have helped Louise carefully fold and pack Catherine’s trousseau.
7,le 13 novembre 1666,"Kateri is much better, but seeing her in the bed, so unwell, brought back the sad memories of Catherine’s passing."

6,may,“Marriage is a business arrangement of the most delicate sort.
5,le 27 septembre 1666,She welcomed we filles à marier with such generosity.
8,le 14 decembre 1666,"She decided to walk with us, although it had nothing to do with propriety; Monsieur Aubry was a gentleman."
8,le 3 decembre 1666,He and other engagés have worked these last few days with the soldiers to replace a section of the palisade.
6,le 22 octobre 1666,That leaves Marie who never speaks.
2,le 23 juin 1666,"Besides, Minette likes Kateri and she is the best judge of character that I know."
10,le 4 février 1667,"Séraphin told her that he had worked hard this morning, mucking out the cowshed and chopping wood, so Tante Barbe agreed."
4,le 24 août 1666,"No ice mountains have been sighted, either."
12,le 13 avril 1667,"With the fine weather, the forest across the river has begun to come alive once more."

11,le 20 mars 1667,"“You know, yourself,” he said, “to leave a sickbed too soon is foolishness.” I whispered to him that one more dose of that tea would have drowned me."
2,le 13 juin 1666,I am used to odours; the dovecote was all feathery and the barn had milk cows and sometimes their calves.
6,may,There is a rumble of low talk and laughter from downstairs.
6,le 25 octobre 1666,Food interests them far more than washing and changing the clothing in which they have been living for weeks.

5,le 6 septembre 1666,That seemed to satisfy her.
9,le 31 janvier 1667,"So many days have passed since I last opened this diary, that at first I wondered if I would even remember how to write."
6,le 2 octobre 1666,"Madame Laurent says it is indecent, and that we should avert our eyes."
5,le 20 septembre 1666,"I went below to dress presentably, and the stink of the smoke was everywhere."

3,le 13 juillet 1666,I begged Catherine to take a deep breath.
12,le 5 avril 1667,Jean says that the sap has begun to run in the maple trees.
6,le 2 octobre 1666,Kateri says this is called a roach.
5,le 17 septembre 1666,"I was so startled that I could not say a word, only sat there rubbing my arm."
8,le 6 decembre 1666,"“I try, Hélène,” she whispered finally, “but it hurts me.” I held her as she wept."
8,le 4 decembre 1666,They are asleep inside their houses before even we retire for the night.
5,le 17 septembre 1666,I did not dress in my best so that I would be appealing to a single man.

10,le 12 février 1667,"He added that he had heard that some in Montréal are celebrating, and some are even praying that the smallpox takes all the Mohawks."
1,le 19 mai 1666,Then he sighed.
7,le 24 novembre 1666,"One woman was fingering a roll of cloth, her back to us."
7,le 2 novembre 1666,Perhaps in time.

7,le 24 novembre 1666,We walked back in silence.
2,le 28 juin 1666,"Our bedding has an unpleasant dampness to it now, but I am still grateful for the privacy I have as I write this."
5,le 27 septembre 1666,"I might have felt grief rise up in me, yet mercifully it did not."
5,le 27 septembre 1666,"It is wonderful to see him taking pleasure in such things again.” She tilted her head to one side thoughtfully and added, “You and Maman would have liked one another, I think.” I suspect I would have liked this woman, Sesi."
5,le 17 septembre 1666,I suppose that when one is looking for a husband it is important to look appealing at all times.
5,le 29 septembre 1666,Men were waiting outside the convent to carry our chests to the Lower Town.
4,le 27 août 1666,"We pass as much time together as possible, sitting outside when the weather is fine."

6,le 25 octobre 1666,He stood at the doorway and held a lace-trimmed handkerchief over his nose for a moment.
10,may,I hope I never learn the truth of that.

2,le 18 juin 1666,He showed the girls and me the ship today.
6,le 5 octobre 1666,"I have the two rooms upstairs that I let for ten sols a night, and I serve good food and weak beer."
5,le 16 septembre 1666,"I said that my future was too uncertain and at least in this way, if I had no other choice, with a dowry I would be viewed as a possible wife."
9,le 31 janvier 1667,Tante Barbe came later that afternoon to see why I had not returned.
8,le 20 decembre 1666,Her nipples stuck out and were very pink.
5,le 9 septembre 1666,The canoes came quite close to the ship.
3,le 6 juillet 1666,Monsieur Aubry I saw once as he carried a bucket away from her cabin.
6,le 22 octobre 1666,How will she say yes or no to a suitor if she never speaks?
10,may,Monsieur Aubry stood.

8,le 14 decembre 1666,"Few French or even Canadienne girls wear them, but you are sensible and will immediately see why you should.” “Papa!” cried Kateri."
2,may,I made a horrible face at this girl as I combed and put up my hair.
2,le 23 juin 1666,"She rubs against his legs, but he ignores her."
5,le 30 septembre 1666,"“Think of the wonder of such beauty that has never been touched,” I said, and looked back at him to ask if he agreed."
3,le 20 juillet 1666,"They picked her up, set her on a sheet of canvas, and then set a cannon ball near the bottom."
2,le 28 juin 1666,I have not been able to see land for six days.

4,le 24 août 1666,How much longer?
6,may,"I blinked and blinked to force them back, and I could barely see Minette, who happily walked ahead of me on her lead."
12,le 16 avril 1667,He will take me there to pick some in time.
7,le 28 novembre 1666,"Below that was the image of a musket, for many people would not have been able to read the words."
7,le 24 novembre 1666,"I had a list of things for the house that I was to give to the proprietor: candles, soap, flour, lard."
4,le 30 août 1666,How can anyone make a home in such a place?
2,le 28 juin 1666,Often they do not even flap their wings.
6,le 11 octobre 1666,"“Are you certain you do not want to try one, Hélène?” she asked mischievously."
3,le 13 juillet 1666,"It is bold, the others said, to do such things on our own, since decent girls do not wander about unaccompanied by a chaperone."
12,le 12 avril 1667,She did not reach out to play with them as she once had in France.
10,le 10 février 1667,"Inside were a flintlock pistol, a leather belt and two flasks."

2,may,", for he shares this room with no one."
13,le 2 mai 1667,The warrior clearly knew Kateri.
5,le 20 septembre 1666,“We have saved you a place.” I cannot recall whether it was cold or heat that I felt inside myself.
1,le 28 mai 1666,"“You have royal blood, Mademoiselle St. Onge, and you would be a highly desirable bride for someone of the upper class,” Madame Laurent said to Catherine."

13,le 4 mai 1667,"I would tell him I was sorry to ruin his arrangements, but that I had accepted a proposal of marriage from a fine man."
6,may,"leave the message with me, mademoiselle,” she said."
9,le 31 janvier 1667,"“I will run for Séraphin,” Kateri said."
8,le 14 decembre 1666,Their family was well.
4,le 27 août 1666,I must give him the sad news.
5,le 14 septembre 1666,How will this trading drive my life?
2,may,And I thought to myself that now I was certain that I would not mind it so very much.
6,le 25 octobre 1666,We were warm under the quilts last night and it is warm enough downstairs.
4,le 21 août 1666,"The ice mountains are dreadfully dangerous to the ship, and all care must be taken to steer clear of them."
8,le 6 decembre 1666,"Rather, Kateri was spinning and I was creating knots in the wool."

11,le 10 mars 1667,There are no sugared almonds or brandied fruit.
13,le 2 mai 1667,"“Hélène,” she cried."
8,le 20 decembre 1666,"My little Minette, who is still a kitten to me, was to be a mother."
10,Février,I wonder if I will ever be able to guess which of them is the papa of the dear kittens?
13,le 4 mai 1667,"We sat quietly talking as Minette and the kittens played, Kateri having brought Kanon’tinekens along."
5,le 17 septembre 1666,"One of the men, a prosperous looking sort with a plump belly, took Monsieur Deschamps aside and asked him something."

6,le 8 octobre 1666,He introduced himself.
3,le 14 juillet 1666,The sunlight sparkled on the water and men laughed.
6,le 25 octobre 1666,That is why Tante Barbe called for us to help.
2,le 26 juin 1666,Perhaps it is.
6,may,"Flakes of snow were falling outside, and he decided then that he must quickly set out."
5,le 27 septembre 1666,"The rings, now blessed, were slipped upon the fingers of the Maries."
4,le 28 août 1666,It rained hard early this morning.
6,may,Yet Monsieur Aubry wed a Mohawk woman and so Kateri is half Mohawk.
4,le 28 août 1666,"After all, it is only linen."
5,le 24 septembre 1666,Then he went off with Kateri to arrange for the canoes that will carry us to Montréal.
13,le 2 mai 1667,He is one of my companions from the village who has come here to trade.” Behind Jean were other warriors.
8,le 14 decembre 1666,Minette jumped up on the workbench and stretched out.
8,le 14 decembre 1666,She bustled through the room and out again.
2,le 20 juin 1666,This he took off and set carefully down on a chair.
8,le 5 decembre 1666,They say Montréal might have failed had it not been for her.
5,le 17 septembre 1666,Some were Indians who had been removing bales of furs from their canoes.
2,le 14 juin 1666,"That is why the room is called the Sainte-Barbe, I learned."
6,may,"be so, but there truly is a savagery and wildness in the appearance of these Mohawks that was at first disturbing."
9,le 6 janvier,That has all changed.” I could not say a word at first.
3,le 5 juillet 1666,Monsieur Aubry was on the deck.
6,may,How sad her beloved Armand would be.
5,le 20 septembre 1666,Sailors ran everywhere.
13,le 2 mai 1667,"“Hélène and Kateri, you foolish girls, you have disobeyed me, and I cannot think of what to do with you."

3,le 17 juillet 1666,I cannot sleep.
6,may,Silence.
9,le 6 janvier,Séraphin came to fetch me.
6,may,“Who was she?” asked Armand’s wife in confusion.
5,le 27 septembre 1666,"When it all ended, Marie with the freckles had become Madame LaForêt, and short Marie had been transformed into Madame Doner."
2,may,Such a lovely handkerchief.
2,may,"Ah, Minette, I said to myself, stroking her back."
9,le 31 janvier 1667,I only prayed that Kateri would not become ill with it.
13,le 2 mai 1667,"All I could do was stare at Minette, who sat close to the fire, asleep."
10,le 17 février 1667,This is spruce essence.
12,le 13 avril 1667,Today was so mild that we threw open all the shutters to freshen the air in the rooms.
2,may,"I assured her that I would take care, that my prayers had been said, and see how well I had braided my hair."
12,le 21 avril 1667,"An orange kitten went to Marie and her new husband, Monsieur Lespérance."
10,le 20 février 1667,I suspect that Séraphin would rather have a game of cards or tric-trac .
5,le 6 septembre 1666,Will you not consider taking your sister’s place?
10,le 3 février 1667,The room was very smoky and their pipes were making her dear niece’s eyes red.
1,le 26 mai 1666,I will apologize to Madeleine.
10,le 10 février 1667,Something important.
7,le 11 novembre 1666,She has the cowpox.
6,may,"Yes, he knew the location of the Lecôté house."
2,may,Then when we marry we will receive perhaps thirty livres .
3,le 26 juillet 1666,"“I have seen you writing in your own journal in the past, mademoiselle."
1,le 8 mai 1666,Was it Maman’s or Papa’s?
5,le 9 septembre 1666,The men in them laughed and called out in their own tongue.
12,le 12 avril 1667,I walked to the gate through a light drizzle to see for myself.
6,le 10 octobre 1666,"You have to be rough and strong to survive, and if their manners are not those of the court, then such is life.” She is correct, I suppose, but it will take me a while to become accustomed to Sundays."
10,le 10 février 1667,“This weapon
3,le 13 juillet 1666,"Besides, Minette was there with us, and she can be very fierce when she takes it into her head that I need defending."
5,may,believe that I imagined them.
2,le 7 juin 1666,"Some small skeins of brightly coloured linen thread, and my lucet for making cord."
10,le 2 février 1667,"“I will make certain not to warn him,” he promised."
10,le 16 février 1667,There is a feverish ailment of the lungs and there are some cases of measles.
6,le 12 octobre 1666,"Then Minette suddenly walked in, with burrs in her fur."
5,le 14 septembre 1666,"“Furs, mademoiselle."
3,le 27 juillet 1666,"But if that is the only way I can keep you both close to me, I will suffer it, though it hurts so."
10,le 3 février 1667,With elaborate courtesy I asked him to please cease this.
12,le 20 avril 1667,"The happy news, though, is that Kateri, her kitten, and Ourson are staying with us."
9,le 6 janvier,"Then I said yes, I agreed to spend time with him pleasantly, so that we might get to know each other."
10,le 2 février 1667,I made myself very small inside my wrappings.
8,le 14 decembre 1666,I will say a prayer for Monsieur Aubry before I sleep.
10,may,"“Put Deschamps from your mind,” he said firmly."
7,may,Minette waited patiently for her bowl of milk still warm from Brune.
8,le 6 decembre 1666,My hand is shaking as I write this.
13,le 2 mai 1667,"On she went, until she paused for breath and shook her head."
5,le 27 septembre 1666,What a day!
5,le 20 septembre 1666,Smoke swirled around her.
7,may,"Both cows had the cowpox on their udders, so I was very gentle."
7,le 25 novembre 1666,My sister was in my thoughts all day.
8,le 14 decembre 1666,"Monsieur Aubry tried to pay her for the food Kateri had eaten these last weeks, but Tante Barbe waved away the notion."
9,le 6 janvier,His cheeks were covered in scabs.
2,may,"See, there is more."
5,le 16 septembre 1666,"You are not the sort of girl a man looks at twice.” I felt a strange hollow pang in my belly that he should agree, but then he added, “Many times, perhaps, but never just twice.” He bowed and went below."
6,may,"Bonne nuit , Kateri, ” I answered."
10,le 2 février 1667,I answered his greeting.
10,le 19 février 1667,"There are no guilds here, but Séraphin will learn the craft just as Monsieur Aubry did in France."
12,le 5 avril 1667,"Sweeping is not good enough since the weather is suddenly milder, and the snow is melting."
2,le 21 juin 1666,"I intend to speak with each one of them, if I can."
13,le 2 mai 1667,I followed the prints to the open gate of the palisade.
10,le 9 février 1667,"It was Marie with the mole beside her mouth, and her husband."
6,le 8 octobre 1666,Séraphin has come to the house!
2,may,They said nothing.
2,le 17 juin 1666,"They are country girls, strong, hardy and quite merry."
3,le 26 juillet 1666,"That it was his life’s work, but he had not lived to see it published."
9,le 31 janvier 1667,"He was covered with the pox blisters, and I had to tie mittens over his hands so that he did not claw himself."
1,le 9 mai 1666,"There is so much to write, if I am to keep this as a proper record of my life."
6,le 19 octobre 1666,"If Kateri was willing to help me with the work here, it would suffice."
12,le 30 avril 1667,"It is only a cat, some would say, but I have to find her."
3,le 20 juillet 1666,I could not watch.
8,le 14 decembre 1666,I vow that is the only way to describe the way she walks.
2,may,"I had at my neck the cross that Papa made for Maman before they were wed, and on my finger, the silver mourning ring I have worn since Papa died."
6,may,Then I will escort you and your belongings to la Soeur Bourgeoys’s house before I take Kateri home to my shop.
4,le 21 août 1666,One man rings a bell.
8,le 14 decembre 1666,"They were the winter shoes of the Indians, made of heavy greased leather, he explained."
5,le 20 septembre 1666,"I was sleeping soundly with Minette curled at my feet, when I was wakened by shouts outside my cabin."
4,le 24 août 1666,I watched it disappear behind us.
6,le 16 octobre 1666,Tante Barbe has another piece of land outside the town.
10,le 14 février 1667,I loaded the pistol and fired again.
2,may,The mirror showed me a thin girl with a serious expression.
1,may,There are not enough women in New France.
2,may,"Minette followed me as far as the door, and then scampered off in search of her breakfast in the kitchen."
6,le 1 octobre 1666,"Those I recognized, for I used to walk in the woods and search for them with Papa after a warm rain."
2,le 21 juin 1666,"There are merchants, and farmers, and even a young girl that they say is an Indian."
5,le 28 septembre 1666,The wedding fête lasted until very late.
8,le 12 decembre 1666,"Our room is so cold tonight, that both Kateri and I wore two pairs of stockings to I begin again."
2,le 17 juin 1666,Catherine has a headache and I believe it is best she is left alone in the quiet to rest.
6,le 5 octobre 1666,Then lye soap chips were added to the pot.
1,may,He will be writing a letter of recommendation for Catherine if she goes.
12,may,"“Try it on.” When I expressed my doubts Tante Barbe said, “Hélène, you do not seem to realize that you have grown these last months."
6,le 4 octobre 1666,I slept late.
2,le 20 juin 1666,"On his head, atop his wig, perched an elegant beaver hat."
2,le 20 juin 1666,Perhaps he should purchase a wig.
6,may,Who has filled your head with such drivel?” He had the good sense not to glance at Tante Barbe.
6,may,"“A wife needs to have many skills, Hélène."
12,may,"It is her solution to many problems, and as always, it helped."
4,may,It is the first time I have seen him smile and heard his laughter.
3,le 28 juillet 1666,I spent an hour with Kateri today.
10,le 17 février 1667,Then we put it into barrels so that it could ferment for three days.
2,may,"“There is nothing for me here, Hélène."
2,le 7 juin 1666,Catherine said it was very silly of me to bring along something so unnecessary.
10,le 15 février 1667,"Children played outside, and rolled the snow into balls to build snow people, just as children do in France."
8,le 14 decembre 1666,"Hélène’s tourtières are delicious, for she is a good cook."
6,may,I thanked Monsieur Aubry while my belongings were carried in and up the narrow staircase to the second floor.
12,le 13 avril 1667,Yet I must admit that I was tempted by the tiny ferns that Jean called têtes de violon .
6,le 12 octobre 1666,"“Cats love to wander.” I admit she was purring quite happily, even when I brushed the burrs from her coat."
13,le 2 mai 1667,I went out to search for Minette.
13,le 4 mai 1667,It was the tall man who had arrived with les filles à marier and Madame Laurent.
4,le 14 août 1666,"At mass, I shall pray for Catherine with all my heart."
8,le 9 decembre 1666,"A heavy, wet snow."
12,le 19 avril 1667,"What a sight he was!” Back in France, I thought that the charivari was very amusing."
7,le 24 novembre 1666,"Maman’s family is there, my grandmother and grandfather and everyone else.” She stopped in the street, fumbled about in her pocket, and pulled out her handkerchief."
1,le 26 mai 1666,I called Madeleine a sheep.
6,le 19 octobre 1666,"“Madame, with your permission, there is something I wish to ask your niece.” “I would be careful what I asked her if I were you, Monsieur Aubry."
12,le 16 avril 1667,"Some are venturing out to inspect the fields they will soon begin to plough, and some are simply out for the pleasure of it."
10,le 10 février 1667,"I was armed, I remarked, but I had no idea of how to shoot."
5,le 16 septembre 1666,"Now that I think on it, I am not certain exactly what he meant."
10,le 17 février 1667,"There is nothing like fresh spruce beer.” I have not been impressed with the odour of the old spruce beer we have been serving, so perhaps she is correct."
9,le 6 janvier,I told him then that Monsieur Deschamps had made an offer of marriage to me.
2,le 15 juin 1666,She did not laugh.
7,le 28 novembre 1666,Tante Barbe thought that Monsieur Aubry was wise to purchase this building.
5,le 17 septembre 1666,"The Maries could not compete with Monsieur Deschamps, though, who wore fashionably full breeches and shoes with ribbons."
6,may,I help you?” I asked to speak with Armand Lecôté.
8,le 6 decembre 1666,"“My father loved my mother very much, Hélène."
12,le 28 avril 1667,"I fear the night will be a sleepless one, for I cannot find Minette or Sottise."
2,may,"If we are going, why should Minette not come along?"
5,le 29 septembre 1666,"My, what a happy coincidence that was."
5,le 29 septembre 1666,Gone was the felt hat and full petticoat breeches.
7,le 11 novembre 1666,"So I read to her, tell her stories, and we make plans for the days of Christmas."
4,le 24 août 1666,"New France is far inside the country,” he explained."
6,le 3 octobre 1666,"The Mohawks, who had their camp some distance away from ours, seemed to find this entertaining."
8,le 14 decembre 1666,"“Yes, join them, Hélène,” Tante Barbe ordered."
5,le 20 septembre 1666,"I heard Séraphin climb back onto the ship, and then the dipping of the oars as the boat pulled away toward shore."
4,le 27 août 1666,"None of the Maries are as plump as when we left La Rochelle, but all are in excellent spirits."
8,le 21 decembre 1666,"I have a touch of illness, mademoiselle, but if I am well, then, oui , I will attend mass with you,” he said tiredly."
6,le 26 octobre 1666,"For the rest of this winter there will be the inside work and the feeding of the farm animals, but when spring comes both of them will work beside their husbands clearing the land and planting the crops."
2,le 15 juin 1666,I shared my eggs with Minette.
10,may,"Until later, then.” Out he swept."
4,le 24 août 1666,All around here are the fishing grounds.
2,le 23 juin 1666,"Her father, Monsieur Jean Aubry, is a gunsmith who keeps a shop in Montréal."
6,may,I had just raised my hand to knock again when a young woman opened the door.
9,le 6 janvier,Monsieur Aubry said he agreed.
6,le 12 octobre 1666,It would not be kind to tie Minette.
4,may,"He laughed at that and said, “ Quelle surprise!"
5,le 14 septembre 1666,"I expected a good deal from New France, and this place, standing alone in such a wilderness, has moved me deeply."
2,le 15 juin 1666,It groans and creaks all around me.
12,le 18 avril 1667,Would you consider my proposal of marriage?
5,le 24 septembre 1666,"I was almost sad to leave our vessel this morning, since it has been my home all these months."
8,le 5 decembre 1666,Montréal is not like La Rochelle or even Reignac.
10,le 10 février 1667,"“You saved my life,” he said."
10,Février,"One is black like Minette, two are orange, and two are grey."
4,le 28 août 1666,I felt tears burning in my eyes.
3,le 6 juillet 1666,He nodded to me and I think I saw respect in his eyes.
6,le 25 octobre 1666,He sighed dramatically.
6,le 14 octobre 1666,This did not please him.
8,le 14 decembre 1666,"“She is at home here, mademoiselle.” I turned and faced Monsieur Aubry."
5,le 17 septembre 1666,"She was just reaching out to pinch me again when Monsieur Aubry said sweetly, “You had best hold onto the boat’s rail, Madame Laurent."
4,le 27 août 1666,The girls talk ceaselessly of the men they will marry.
6,le 4 octobre 1666,"There was cheese and fresh bread, a boiled egg and, unbelievably, a pot of chocolate."
5,le 27 septembre 1666,We decorated the altar inside the church Notre-Dame-de-l’Immaculée-Conception with the goldenrod and asters that grow wild in places down in the Lower Town.
6,le 1 octobre 1666,"They said back in France that the King is very fond of mushrooms, and that he has them grown for his table."
1,may,"Catherine says Madeleine does not wish to have two unmarried females under this roof, especially if young men come to call."
6,may,"Even from where I stood, I could hear the sound of laughter and smell food."
1,may,"“The woman keeps a tavern, monsieur,” snapped Catherine."
1,may,Does that make Anne a lamb?
8,le 5 decembre 1666,“How good she was to my dear husband Jules when he died.” Jeanne Mance is yet another kind woman who thinks only of others.
9,le 6 janvier,"Even Séraphin, who is not particular about such things, wrinkled his nose at me."
6,may,"Your papa made a good beginning, but this is New France.” Tomorrow we will begin."
5,le 30 septembre 1666,Now I understand that it is a bastion of civilization in this wilderness.
6,le 2 octobre 1666,"If I avert my eyes, how can I see and then describe it here?"
5,le 30 septembre 1666,"He was watching me carefully, a thoughtful look in his expression."
6,le 5 octobre 1666,"Chickens, and a cross-looking rooster with a very fine tail scratched in the dirt."
6,may,"try it myself some time, but not soon."
7,le 8 novembre 1666,We tightened the ropes before retiring tonight.
2,may,"There are mice and rats in New France, are there not, madame?"
4,le 14 août 1666,"Kateri smells nothing either, but Monsieur Aubry agrees with Séraphin."
7,may,Tante Barbe uses only glazed earthenware in the common room.
10,le 22 février 1667,More and more soldiers of the Carignan-Salières Regiment are being brought back from Fort St.-Louis.
9,le 6 janvier,He said it was good to see me without a window frame between us.
6,le 5 octobre 1666,The fighting it causes!
5,le 14 septembre 1666,Stadacona.
6,le 22 octobre 1666,"It also leaves me, I suppose."
7,may,But it was agreeable enough this morning when Kateri and I went out to feed the chickens and to milk.
6,le 3 octobre 1666,She must make a suitable first impression on the Lecôtés.
10,may,Otherwise the barrels would explode.
13,le 2 mai 1667,"If we misjudged, we might fall into the open water of the St. Lawrence and drown."
5,le 29 septembre 1666,At least they were cheerful.
1,le 19 mai 1666,"I will have only Catherine, and Minette of course, loyal Minette who hisses each time she sees Madeleine."
3,le 6 juillet 1666,"There is a storm and it is becoming difficult to write, even though I have squeezed myself into a corner of our bed."
6,may,"He could not see that vile sort of existence for me, it seemed."
8,le 14 decembre 1666,This is something you need.
5,le 29 septembre 1666,He now wore the same sort of clothing as the other men in the canoe.
5,le 27 septembre 1666,I made my confession at last to one of the priests at the church here.
6,may,"I can provide you with a bed until you find a position.” “Merci, Monsieur Aubry,” said Séraphin in great relief."
1,le 26 mai 1666,I do tend to be a little proud of how well I write.
1,may,Rainbows still make me smile.
6,may,Is there danger?
5,le 29 septembre 1666,He also wore many weapons.
12,le 20 avril 1667,Good news and melancholy news.
3,le 14 juillet 1666,The sailors danced on the deck this morning.
5,le 17 septembre 1666,I stuck my tongue out at Madame Laurent.
6,le 5 octobre 1666,For very bad stains the cloth might need to be soaked in sour milk for a week or so first.
4,le 28 août 1666,We set out buckets and basins and the captain has let us use some of the water to wash out our clothing.
12,le 20 avril 1667,How odd.
5,le 9 septembre 1666,My mouth grew dry to think that the Indians in those canoes might attack us.
10,may,"“You have your answer, Deschamps."
5,le 25 septembre 1666,They each now have a little brass ring from their future husbands.
6,le 3 octobre 1666,"I wish to see them settled, for I will return to Québec in a few days.” She turned to us."
12,may,"We unpacked the clothing and, in an instant, I was back in France folding these lovely garments."
1,may,"Papa’s brother Jules, who died years ago, lived in Montréal and married a widow."
13,le 2 mai 1667,So did the footprints of Kateri.
6,le 5 octobre 1666,Then we would hang them on a line.
8,le 5 decembre 1666,"She began the hospital of Hôtel-Dieu here, and her first patients were men wounded in battle with the Iroquois."
8,le 3 decembre 1666,“We would not be nearly as safe here without a strong palisade for protection.” He paused since Kateri was in the kitchen with us.
4,le 28 août 1666,Only a kindness.
12,le 13 avril 1667,Jean brought something to the house tonight.
3,le 17 juillet 1666,The moaning of the sick girls fills the air.
5,le 9 septembre 1666,Our ship was sailing against the current with a strong breeze behind her.
6,le 4 octobre 1666,"I admit that I feel guilty just lying here, but not so guilty that I could not have a second cup of chocolate."
6,le 14 octobre 1666,"The girls who came across on our ship are decent enough, I suppose, but there is no unwed girl in Montréal at the moment who has your lineage.” It sounded as though he were discussing a horse."
3,le 13 juillet 1666,All were feeling stronger.
5,le 27 septembre 1666,The contredanses and gigues à deux were all such fun.
6,may,But for now you need hot soup in your belly and a quiet night’s sleep.
9,le 6 janvier,I have always wondered about that.
6,le 19 octobre 1666,"“Kateri could remain at the shop,” he explained, “but I prefer that she not be alone."
10,le 20 février 1667,There was Monsieur Deschamps.
5,le 26 septembre 1666,Happy news.
2,le 30 juin 1666,"He watched the sky and talked with Captain Renville, who was also staring upwards."
7,may,"not think snow is so beautiful when it is up to your waist, Hélène.” I have been told many times about the winters in New France."
2,le 30 juin 1666,"There was not a cloud against the deep blue above us, and so I can only imagine what they thought."
10,le 2 février 1667,Other traines slid over the snow behind them.
11,le 15 mars 1667,"Mademoiselle Mance said that she has seen it many times before, and almost always in the winter."
13,le 2 mai 1667,"I paused then, and ran back up the stairs to my room."
7,le 28 novembre 1666,"The shutters, closed tightly in Monsieur Aubry’s absence, were painted a dark green, as was the door."
5,le 27 septembre 1666,She learned the language of the Indians.
12,le 13 avril 1667,I will not.
2,le 30 juin 1666,I gazed up at the sky as well.
3,le 14 juillet 1666,One of them played a small flute and another beat upon a drum.
5,le 28 septembre 1666,"It would be uncomfortable, as I would be sleeping in my gown until we reached Montréal."
6,le 5 octobre 1666,"“That is the first lesson you have learned today, Hélène."
8,le 14 decembre 1666,I had learned that.
2,le 6 juin 1666,Cousin Pierre has shown us a kindness in the form of a gift of money.
7,may,"Your chaussons , too."
2,le 26 juin 1666,Séraphin knows the names of all the sails.
6,may,"Yes, you"
9,le 31 janvier 1667,She said she could not carry him to his bed.
6,may,"Would I prefer a life of work wed to a poor habitant , or the one he could give me?"
6,may,Then he walked to the door and pulled it open.
6,may,"I cannot believe I did it, but I said to him, “I do regret this, Monsieur Deschamps."
12,le 21 avril 1667,Tante Barbe and I will keep the black kitten.
7,le 25 novembre 1666,"I wish that I could talk to him of this, but I cannot."
13,le 2 mai 1667,"If I was killed or taken, that would be one thing."
5,le 20 septembre 1666,Anger does that to me.
5,le 29 septembre 1666,It was Monsieur Aubry who gave me the first of his surprises.
11,le 12 mars 1667,"Beyond the palisade and the town, life is surely much harder for the people."
1,le 18 mai 1666,Servants!
3,le 3 juillet 1666,"When I climbed into bed next to Catherine she asked, “Are you afraid, Hélène?” I had left a candle burning in the hanging lantern."
6,le 25 octobre 1666,"I am taking only a few more minutes in bed to write, before we prepare ourselves to leap up and dress in the cold."
2,may,"Catherine wrinkles her nose to think of such a thing, but it could be most interesting."
8,le 14 decembre 1666,"One moment the room is empty, and then it is filled with the presence of Tante Barbe."
13,le 2 mai 1667,She is either very unwise or most fearless.” I felt my whole being sag as I let the pistol drop to my side.
10,le 10 février 1667,"“I made this pistol myself, and so it is of the highest quality."
5,le 26 septembre 1666,It makes me think.
5,le 23 septembre 1666,"“I will only permit this if we all travel together,” Monsieur Deschamps insisted."
2,may,"As always, Louise scolded that I should not drip ink upon the coverlet, and asked if I had said my prayers."
13,le 4 mai 1667,"This page is all blotted, so I have tried to calm myself before I begin again."
2,le 6 juin 1666,Monsieur Deschamps received ten livres from that as a fee for enlisting her.
1,may,"now finish this entry, since Père Simard has explained."
1,may,They then proposed something to Catherine that took the very breath from my lungs.
4,le 14 août 1666,I smell only the ocean and the stink of the ship if I am below.
10,may,"After all, I do not see well at all and I like Indians."
3,le 3 juillet 1666,"Still, I am certain that a glint of fear was in her eyes."
2,le 15 juin 1666,There were pears and slices of lemon.
6,le 25 octobre 1666,It was extremely cold last night and today the wind is blowing hard.
2,le 28 juin 1666,"I do hope you enjoy the sight of water.” I knew this, but to hear it from the mouth of a sailor made it seem too real."
10,le 10 février 1667,Monsieur Aubry set the bundle down on the table and unwrapped it.
5,le 16 septembre 1666,I was surprised that he took only a few minutes to find me out on the deck.
7,le 28 novembre 1666,"It was not nearly as large as some of the other houses owned by the wealthy merchants on this street, but it had an elegant appearance."
5,le 23 septembre 1666,"“Make no mistake, mademoiselle,” he said."
5,le 17 septembre 1666,What had seemed to be solid earth was not.
10,le 9 février 1667,One could tell by the arrows that were left in the bodies.
13,le 4 mai 1667,"Once he sat drinking on the other side of the room, and Tante Barbe had returned to her chair, I broke the seal on the letter and began to read it aloud."
2,le 21 juin 1666,Papa used to say that knowledge gives strength.
6,le 11 octobre 1666,"I admit that I am not above accepting even the Spanish coins that the officials despise.” Under her breath she added, “The foolish men.” Then she went on cheerily, “For today, the muskrats will suffice.” Here is where the work began."
6,le 15 octobre 1666,This I do not mind.
5,le 28 septembre 1666,I thanked Monsieur Aubry politely when he handed her back.
6,le 11 octobre 1666,he laughed.
4,le 4 août 1666,Give me time.
13,le 2 mai 1667,And that my Minette has been gone for days in this storm.
13,le 2 mai 1667,"To my relief, Jean no longer seemed so cross, although he should have been, I suppose."
1,may,"If I am not here, the words I write will tell my story."
5,le 20 septembre 1666,What should I carry out?
7,le 8 novembre 1666,Kateri means Catherine.
6,may,"Monsieur Aubry was speaking to an exceedingly short, plump woman."
5,le 9 septembre 1666,"Suddenly, three canoes came into sight, moving as quickly as though there were no current at all."
5,le 28 septembre 1666,He clearly did.
9,le 31 janvier 1667,He moaned and turned his head to the side.
2,may,To me she was as lovely as a princess.
6,may,"I think of myself as a brave person, but beneath my skirts my legs were unsteady."
3,le 15 juillet 1666,"The captain says that something very large, perhaps a shark, must have been hunting them."
13,le 2 mai 1667,Kateri!
7,le 28 novembre 1666,And it was.
10,le 3 février 1667,I thanked le bon Dieu that Kateri had been in the kitchen with Tante Barbe and had not heard.
7,le 25 novembre 1666,Catherine was at her happiest during such times.
10,le 20 février 1667,Monsieur Aubry enjoys a cup of spruce beer.
5,le 27 septembre 1666,"I cannot see how it might have been possible for them to look happier, but they did."
12,le 30 avril 1667,"No amount of calling helped, and so we have returned home."
2,may,"At this, she sniffed and gave a sad sigh."
2,may,"Her eyes are a clear blue, but this morning they were red, and I know she had been weeping, as I had."
8,le 14 decembre 1666,"He lit a fire with a striker and flint, blowing carefully on the little spark that caught in the charcloth."
6,le 1 octobre 1666,I wonder what he would think of such a thing as a puffball?
10,le 10 février 1667,"I despair of it, and thank her in my prayers all at the same time."
3,le 13 juillet 1666,The sun was just setting.
5,le 9 septembre 1666,I heard the stomping of his feet as he went below.
2,le 14 juin 1666,She is the patron saint of cannoniers.
10,may,“At worst it could keep you from falling into the hands of Indians.” I agreed to his plan and so did Tante Barbe.
1,le 26 mai 1666,He said no.
6,le 11 octobre 1666,"They ate the meat from the heads, they ate the tongues, and then they cracked open the skulls, scooped out the brains and ate those as well."
2,le 15 juin 1666,"Catherine normally would have grumbled, but she is so unhappy with this that she said nothing, only stood there with tears in her eyes."
13,le 4 mai 1667,It would not take me long to write an answer to my cousin.
2,may,"Tears came to my eyes, although I loathe to cry."
6,may,"He had a little smile on his lips as he agreed that, perhaps, it would."
5,may,"I folded my legs quite comfortably, and covered my lap and Minette’s basket with a blanket."
12,le 18 avril 1667,It has been my hope you would see that we could make a good life together.
2,may,"Before we left her chamber Catherine set her hands upon my shoulders and said, “We will be happy in New France, Hélène."
6,le 12 octobre 1666,Minette wandered today.
6,le 26 octobre 1666,The weddings were joyful events.
7,le 28 novembre 1666,There were two storeys.
5,le 17 septembre 1666,It unsettled my mind.
8,le 19 decembre 1666,They have accepted.
2,le 22 juin 1666,I stood on deck and watched France disappear in the mist.
5,le 23 septembre 1666,Some say they will remain here.
1,may,"Papa once told me that the morning I was born a fierce storm arose, and I came into this world in the midst of it."
8,le 14 decembre 1666,"Perhaps I have a cold.” We walked back in companionable silence, although he coughed now and again."
