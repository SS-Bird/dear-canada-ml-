10,April 1816,"We speak in a mixture of English and Cree, but naturally I cannot write the Cree down here so I will write it all as if it were in English."
05,November 1815,But at least now I sit by a fire and my hands are warm enough to hold my pen.
12,June 1816,"“No,” she said firmly, holding onto me."
05,November 1815,"The shaman, who is their medicine man and their spiritual leader — rather like our elder, I suppose — chose the site."

17,November 1816,I vowed to write only short passages and see how I have blathered on.

13,July 1816,Father and the other men often meet and talk after camp is set up about what to do once we get to Jack River.
10,April 1816,"“Then they will choose not to be,” he answered."

12,June 1816,At this point it looks likely that we will be returning to Scotland.
12,June 1816,"She had no skills at making friends since her father had kept her separated from people all these years, and she must have tried to ingratiate herself with me in the only way she knew how — in a way that would not hurt her pride."

17,November 1816,"Alice, unfortunately, has decided that Kate is dissembling in order to find favour with James, and has begun to hate her."

12,June 1816,He says he escaped from the Métis camp at Portage la Prairie.
15,September 1816,"Then we hurried after Bends Fingers to their encampment, which is through a beautiful stand of tall pine trees and low bushes."
15,September 1816,Everything that we must buy from the store puts us further into debt with the Company.
02,August 1815,The bars have been removed so wood can be burned instead.

10,April 1816,"“But how could you be my friend,” I blurted out, “when you are taking my father away?” She looked at me for a long time and then took my hand."
18,December 1816,It is a strange thing.
03,September 1815,The younger boys teased me mercilessly.

05,November 1815,"I assumed that I would see none of the hunt, but in fact I will be able to witness almost all of it."
05,November 1815,It was chaos as news was exchanged.
05,November 1815,Suddenly we heard pounding and thudding and the ground shook beneath our feet.
10,April 1816,After it was over we ate and Jasper McKay played at the pipes.
05,November 1815,"But if they do not pray to our God, to whom do these savages pray?"
05,November 1815,Bagpipes were played and people danced.
10,April 1816,"He says he learned much about it when we were living so close to them, especially when he went hunting with the Indian men."

15,September 1816,Big news!

11,May 1816,If I were her I would be furious with me.

05,November 1815,So I continue: When we awoke the next morning it was to a terrible sight.
12,June 1816,We did not know what fate would befall us at their hands and I had to force myself to try to stay calm.
05,November 1815,It  take me a few days of writing to tell everything that happened.
02,August 1815,"She said that she was going to a better place where she would dance with the angels until Father came to claim her, and that we too must carry on to our better place."
14,August 1816,"They are trying to understand what has gone wrong with all our plans, and I listen closely."
03,September 1815,Now that we are walking the girl never leaves my side.
11,May 1816,Spring!
04,October 1815,"We are still in tents, as there is no room for all of us in the buildings, but tonight we are eating fresh fish, and tomorrow we can wash our clothes!"
02,August 1815,I sit in front of the fire as everyone sleeps (still here at York Factory) in order to impart this most terrible news.
18,December 1816,I try not to be depressed by our prospects but it isn’t easy.
02,August 1815,We are held fast by the ice.
04,October 1815,Heaven.
07,January 1816,I should have sat quietly in the tipi sewing or mending.
02,August 1815,They dress in deerskins and wear bright red sashes around their waists.
08,February 1816,"The tips of buffalo horns are rounded off to make little smooth stones and the young boys roll the stones down the slope, scoring points when they drop into the different holes."

14,August 1816,"It was a good thing because otherwise we would have been filled with gloom, thinking how we have come to such a pass."
15,September 1816,White Loon works all day.
13,July 1816,"It was the same for the other settlers, so almost all of the women and children are wearing clothes that have practically turned into shreds."
09,March 1816,"But the storm came on so quickly it soon became apparent they would never reach camp by nightfall, or rather the storm would reach them before they reached camp."
07,January 1816,This took them over two days of backbreaking work.
09,March 1816,Evening James is alive!
05,November 1815,Robbie pulled my attention away from her at that moment.
02,August 1815,Our room has a grate made for burning coal.
03,September 1815,There is one bright spot.
05,November 1815,"The day after Robbie’s near disaster, the sun shone bright and the snow glittered and sparkled with such glory it seemed we had woken to a magical land."
12,June 1816,Perhaps she herself was torn about his allegiance.
05,November 1815,"“Don’t faint, Little Princess,” Kate called to me."
04,October 1815,"Shrubs and pines give way to majestic old trees: oak, elm, poplar and maple."
12,June 1816,She had obviously heard something.
13,July 1816,Terrible thunderstorms today.
07,January 1816,When we arrived at our first camping ground nearer the buffalo herds we set up a small tent that Father had bought before we left.
11,May 1816,She is as friendly as ever and does not seem to resent me for my ungracious behaviour.
18,December 1816,"I saw Father shed a tear — in fact, there was not a dry eye to be seen."
06,December 1815,Secretly I wonder if she is not right.
09,March 1816,We must hope that they will dig us out.” It was a horrible wait.
03,September 1815,"He was chased all the way to the river that evening after we had camped, and his only escape was to dive beneath the icy water."
05,November 1815,"“In the spring I shall collect the most beautiful stones from the riverbed here, and make you an even nicer necklace for your thirteenth birthday."
11,May 1816,Tomorrow we start our trip back to The Forks.
13,July 1816,"Everywhere wild flowers are in bloom — blues and bright yellows surround brilliant orange-coloured tiger lilies, and all are set off by the unusual bright orange moss growing on the rocks."
01,July 1815,"We imagined owning our own land, giving you children a better life."
09,March 1816,It is called snow blindness and is not a lasting affliction.
05,November 1815,She took it and gave me the skins and the sinew.
10,April 1816,Her mother and Alice stood with her.
14,August 1816,We have been in the New Land for one year.
17,November 1816,"When she is occupied with something that she is good at, her mood lightens, she smiles and rarely utters a cross or nasty word."
09,March 1816,"I awoke this morning to an eerie silence, the likes of which I have never experienced."
03,September 1815,"All day today the Indians made signs with their hands as if they were snakes, and grinned when they saw me."
02,August 1815,"After the settlers left, the Nor’Westers burnt down everything that had been built there, and even drove off the animals.” This is surely a disaster."
05,November 1815,"Never have I felt so worn out, not even after our terrible walk."
04,October 1815,"It has been nothing but 
portages
 and walking, crying children, and men and women with sore feet and backs."
02,August 1815,"“Remember even before we left Scotland, the Nor’Westers tried to discourage us from coming here?"
02,August 1815,"Passageways that are narrow, and even colder, connect the rooms to each other."
14,August 1816,We found some wonderful patches.
11,May 1816,But the black flies are particularly bad.
01,July 1815,"“You need not convince me, William,” she said."
03,September 1815,"She is like the pesky bugs, hovering about me constantly!"
01,July 1815,She was so excited as we packed.
07,January 1816,"She takes every opportunity to speak with me and to learn our language, and she encourages me to do the same."
02,August 1815,It is on another river — the Hayes River — that also flows into Hudson Bay.
09,March 1816,I plan to wait until we return to Pembina before I write again.
12,June 1816,"When we reached the Fort the first person I saw was Father, waiting by the gates."
12,June 1816,But his manner seemed kind and I was very happy that Kate should find him.
03,September 1815,"She is travelling with her father, her mother long dead."
09,March 1816,We all ran to the door and peered out.
05,November 1815,"Into it they put the heart and lungs of the deer, the shredded fat from the different organs, oatmeal, and a bowl of blood that they harvested from the carcass."
06,December 1815,James and I made the foot into a talisman and put it on a cord for Father.
02,August 1815,But I will try to write what is important to me and hope that will suffice.
05,November 1815,Everyone seemed to talk at once.
07,January 1816,I whooped and screamed with everyone else and then delved into the battle as fiercely as if it were a war.
08,February 1816,“Is that the behaviour of a lady?” she squeals.
09,March 1816,"He had a large bag and he smiled when he saw me and said, “Oatmeal.” I was glad to see that he was regaining his sense of humour — oatmeal, was, after all, the only thing we had to eat besides what the men could hunt, but he held it up as if it were gold."
07,January 1816,Now I am not sure.
02,August 1815,"The ship is navigating through ice fields and the boat lurches from one mountain of ice to the next, the sailors pushing it with their long poles and every once in a while the bottom of the boat making a dreadful sound as it hits the solid ice below."
13,July 1816,We make slow progress.
12,June 1816,We set off and were delighted to discover that one net was filled with fish.
17,November 1816,"Kate’s personality seems to undergo a change at these times, just as it did when her brother was here."
02,August 1815,"There is a hectic hustle and bustle everywhere, as the Hudson’s Bay Company employees stack the animal pelts so they can be loaded onto the schooner, which will take them to the 
Prince of Wales
 for its return voyage."
18,December 1816,"Only a couple of pages left so I cannot give details, but Kate was magnificent."
09,March 1816,Finally we thought we heard something.
09,March 1816,"Outside, you cannot see your hand in front of your face."
05,November 1815,Clouds scurried across a pale blue sky.
10,April 1816,Sometimes I see her talking to Father during the day as the chores are done.
08,February 1816,I could not imagine who would be out making such noise in the middle of the night.
10,April 1816,Apparently Duncan Cameron and the other Nor’ Westers — after Colin Robertson captured them at Fort Gibraltar — were transported to Fort Douglas.
10,April 1816,"“I will be your friend, as always."
12,June 1816,"Father says the two men had a huge fight and Mr. Robertson has decided to leave, saying he cannot stay in the same place as Governor Semple."
07,January 1816,This was certainly not the behaviour of a lady.
12,June 1816,"But then the other man shouted, “Why did you destroy our Fort, you damned rascal?” The two men drew near to each other, the Governor on foot, the other man on his horse."
15,September 1816,The women and girls began to throw the rice and husks into the air.
12,June 1816,He hurried us into the main room where all the settlers were crammed together.
02,August 1815,"I taught them to play it using Robbie the first time: He stands with eyes closed, and hands behind his back."
05,November 1815,"Robbie and I were the fortunate ones, our belongings being on the Red River carts travelling behind us with those on foot."
05,November 1815,At least when I write in these pages it is a chance for me to practise my penmanship and my writing skills.
12,June 1816,"Kate saw me, ran to me, grabbed me and began to sob and sob."
12,June 1816,The Governor is dead.
11,May 1816,"Father says that the Nor’Westers dressed like Indians in war paint, and stole all the furs in the trader’s shipment."
09,March 1816,She babbles on and on about James being foolhardy enough to go out with savages.
12,June 1816,Kate seems inconsolable.
17,November 1816,"In the meantime, as writer and director of the theatrical I must mediate between them, and often find myself caught between my brother, Kate and Alice."
17,November 1816,We will present our theatrical on Hogmanay.
16,October 1816,"Often he goes and eats at the Indian camp with his friends, where he is much happier eating freshly killed meat."
05,November 1815,“How old is he?” she asked me.
10,April 1816,She and her father have moved into a different hut.
13,July 1816,"The first order of business, he says, is to build little cabins for the winter, as we certainly do not want to spend it in tents."
02,August 1815,We are entering Hudson Bay.
03,September 1815,"She has a brother already in the New World, although she says little about him."
08,February 1816,"I am now known among the women as the fiercest, most dangerous player of all the settlers, including Kate, who tried to keep up with me but was unable to."
12,June 1816,We wonder if we should not go live in the Fort.
01,July 1815,“One day we will own our own land.
05,November 1815,I scraped away the flesh as best I could.
01,July 1815,"He lifted the sleeve of one dress, dropped it and then finally spoke."
05,November 1815,“Would he not want you to be with him?” Kate looked down quickly and it was the first time I had ever noticed that she seemed unsure of herself.
07,January 1816,Instead I am nothing more than a servant to savages.
03,September 1815,But last night I was unable to quell my anger.
06,December 1815,And for James I have mended every one of his shirts.
02,August 1815,One of the last ones to ascend grabbed me in a very unceremonious way and pushed me up the ladder.
02,August 1815,And what a joy it was not to be circumscribed by the limits of the ship.
05,November 1815,I certainly admired them.
03,September 1815,"Although we settlers are so many, we were all included in the festivities."
05,November 1815,I cannot participate in Alice’s interest in young men.
05,November 1815,"After all, the only young men here are poor and unlearned."
18,December 1816,"Robbie has been very ill, but White Loon has nursed him back to health using Indian remedies."
05,November 1815,We arrived today at The Forks!
03,September 1815,"I worry about Robbie, who is small and has never had a strong constitution, unlike James and me."
03,September 1815,"Now, to get a gun an Indian would need to produce at least twelve good quality beaver skins."
11,May 1816,"Father says this land is perfect for farming, and the settlers who left for Upper Canada had already begun clearing it."
02,August 1815,I hope I have time in between my work to do a little reading.
17,November 1816,The fishing is over.
13,July 1816,They call it their Rupert’s Land rock collection.
12,June 1816,“Who is in charge here?” Sheriff McDonell stepped forward.
10,April 1816,Be a good hardworking daughter.
05,November 1815,"Finally in  of last year they arrived at The Forks, where they built Fort Douglas."
01,July 1815,Then classes will be held regularly from 11 until 2 daily.
12,June 1816,Father continued.
10,April 1816,"And your father is too young to be without a wife.” Then I realized that I have been thinking only of myself, not of Father at all."
01,July 1815,"It  be your children who will see the easy life, not you at all."
02,August 1815,I felt quite giddy — until I realized that most of the sailors had all climbed back up the ladder.
09,March 1816,What a sight!
05,November 1815,I thanked him and he smiled that foxy smile of his.
16,October 1816,We have all decided that we shall try to tell the story of our last year using humour and song.
09,March 1816,After a few days passed we took it out and pounded it with stone hammers.
05,November 1815,"Robbie was among them, but I was deemed too old and so I was forced to part with him, which made me very anxious, until at the last minute I managed to squeeze onto the boat beside him."
12,June 1816,Later I learned the watchman from the Fort had seen them coming.
01,July 1815,"I wanted to keep him talking, hoping that it would help his grief."
10,April 1816,I still cannot seem to accept this.
05,November 1815,I went to her hut to watch her make haggis.
09,March 1816,"A fresh load of buffalo was dragged into camp by the men after another successful hunt a few weeks ago, and there has been no time to write since then."
05,November 1815,“I also traded for these.” He was wearing a pair of moccasins like the Indians’.
01,July 1815,"They are a fur trading company, and already a rival fur trading company — The North West Company — has been sending men to discourage us from sailing."
16,October 1816,"I am fortunate that I like fish, but Robbie cannot bear even the smell of it."
12,June 1816,"Yes,” he replied, “safe here with me.” He hurried us toward the large building where everyone was gathered."
10,April 1816,"It is true the snow is no longer white, rather a pale grey, but there was a definite smell and feel of spring."
12,June 1816,"“You are my daughter, sister."
10,April 1816,"“No,” she said, softly, “I give him back to you.” I stared at her."
12,June 1816,"If it is here anywhere we must hope they do not find it.” We unpacked the boats, then pitched our tent in a small clearing near the river, after which we lugged our trunks and belongings to the tent."
07,January 1816,"I always try to bear myself with dignity, however, so as not to let them see that my pride is injured."
01,July 1815,"Today I spent some time sewing, altering some of Mother’s dresses so they would fit me."
09,March 1816,Father and White Loon gave me a beautiful Indian necklace.
09,March 1816,"“Father, White Loon says a storm is brewing and James has gone out hunting with her brothers.” Father’s face fell and he looked at White Loon as if she could make the bad weather disappear."
05,November 1815,"The boys would help Father in the fields and I would help Mother, cleaning, mending and, of course, cooking the large meals that the men needed to sustain them as they worked."
12,June 1816,"Even when her father died she did not mention him, but perhaps she was afraid to remind us that her brother was a Nor’Wester after they had murdered so many of our people."
09,March 1816,We all stirred at about the same time.
12,June 1816,But Kate will write you and let you know where we are.” William grasped Father’s hand in his and shook it warmly.
12,June 1816,"We’ve been so worried!” “We were by the river,” I said."
12,June 1816,"I comforted her as best I could, surprised by this display of grief by a girl who had never expressed anything but scorn and contempt for all things, and whom I rarely saw say a word to her father or vice versa."
10,April 1816,"He said that it is not their fault that they are ignorant of the teachings of the Bible, and just as I am educating White Loon, so would others be educated."
12,June 1816,Chief Peguis and his men have brought some of the bodies of those massacred back to the fort to be buried.
01,July 1815,"“What then, Father?” I urged him, even though I could have recited the story myself almost word for word."
05,November 1815,It must have been one of those days when I was unable to write.
02,August 1815,"It seems no matter what I say, she implies that I am putting on airs, even if it is just to say hello or good morning."
03,September 1815,"Dear Diary, After two days of travel, the first thing I must write about are the bugs."
10,April 1816,I am at such a loss I cannot put another word down.
11,May 1816,"This was held together with a paste made of clay, water and straw."
16,October 1816,Then they heat the gum from the spruce tree and pour that into the cracks in the canoe.
11,May 1816,It was as if the entire world around us was in a frenzy of excitement crying Spring!
11,May 1816,He’s so excited he can barely contain himself.
05,November 1815,But then I couldn’t help but consider that perhaps he had got lost in the white snow and couldn’t find his way back.
05,November 1815,He shall be fine.
05,November 1815,"I know what he said is not true, Mother, but I am trying to take your place as best I can."
05,November 1815,As night fell the shaman conducted a ceremony in his tent.
05,November 1815,"Finally, we had the good fortune to run into the boat party of Governor Semple, who had gone on ahead of us."
11,May 1816,The men believe we settlers should stay with him at the Fort until the danger has passed.
12,June 1816,"Father rails against it, saying we have the big gun, they do not and we are in a Fort that cannot easily be breached."
05,November 1815,"She looked sad then, as if I had hurt her feelings."
02,August 1815,I am exhausted.
10,April 1816,What should I say?
05,November 1815,"“Robbie wants one too, and I think he should have one before long."
10,April 1816,Are Indians only savages because they do not accept the Bible?
16,October 1816,Father can say what he likes — Robbie is far too stubborn to listen.
08,February 1816,Robbie was very proud of me.
05,November 1815,"They wintered there, but that was when a fellow called Duncan Cameron of the North West Company convinced many of the settlers to leave for Upper Canada."
15,September 1816,Kate and I are going out in a boat with Bends Fingers to help harvest wild rice.
12,June 1816,"Grant wants the credit, so he’s allowing us to leave."
10,April 1816,And she began to cry.
17,November 1816,I am running out of pages in this diary.
11,May 1816,I will not be able to write again until we arrive.
07,January 1816,"I did not know exactly where I was going, but I was determined not to let the others grab the balls off my stick."
02,August 1815,Kate has begun to keep a close eye on the burgeoning romances that seem to be developing between the single men and women on the boat.
05,November 1815,"They returned in  and began to rebuild what the Nor’Westers burned, but winter has overtaken both them and us.” I cannot yet believe it even though I am reporting it in these pages."
12,June 1816,Their sails were quickly lowered and they put to shore.
12,June 1816,I can write only a few words.
02,August 1815,I couldn’t help but worry that he might cut himself on one of the sharp edges.
08,February 1816,I simply try to put thoughts of Mother and her teachings aside.
03,September 1815,We cook over an open fire.
05,November 1815,"The huts were built today, using round unfinished wood and filling in the cracks with clay."
10,April 1816,“I thought we were …” I answered.
09,March 1816,Evening Still nothing and the storm rages on unabated.
07,January 1816,White Loon’s family encouraged us to set up beside them.
03,September 1815,The same Indian then showed me how to rub mud on our skin to ease the pain of the bites and to prevent new ones.
11,May 1816,"I thought you liked White Loon.” “I did until I found out she was after Father,” I replied."
02,August 1815,"I realize this is a bit of a muddle, this diary writing, but I have never before written in a diary and it must take me a little while to become accustomed to the proper form and to decide what is important to include."
10,April 1816,Finally we will be able to build our own little house and truly begin our lives in the New Land.
11,May 1816,We have been staying at Fort Douglas in a tent ever since we arrived back at The Forks.
13,July 1816,"On the way south, last fall, we faced the difficulties with more courage because we were so full of hope and excitement for the future."
03,September 1815,I was quite defenceless.
14,August 1816,First it seems that there is a ceremony within days of the child being born.
02,August 1815,"I forgot to mention that the leader of our own party of settlers, Governor Semple, has travelled with us to York Factory."
05,November 1815,It is sap from the maple tree and is quite wonderful.
11,May 1816,Father is planting oats and wheat.
01,July 1815,Other than that it was all practicality.
08,February 1816,Robbie has become an expert at a sliding game.
05,November 1815,“I traded for this.” And with a flourish he brought out a bow and arrow.
09,March 1816,I have wrapped him up and fed him oatmeal and hot tea.
09,March 1816,They are his only hope.
05,November 1815,Apparently there is not enough food for us to spend the winter here.
11,May 1816,"Now Governor Semple 
has
 to listen to Colin Robertson about the threat posed by the North West Company."
12,June 1816,"We ate pemmican that night, and stayed the entire next day."
12,June 1816,"It even seemed to me that perhaps White Loon was to be thanked, not censured."
12,June 1816,It seemed a pleasant proposal so I agreed.
05,November 1815,"Finally when everything was in and stitched up, the stomach was suspended high above the flames of the open fire."
12,June 1816,A young man turned around at the sound of her voice.
05,November 1815,"My mother almost died from it and my little sister too, but we were lucky, we were the lucky ones."
05,November 1815,"She had a nice face, round with black eyes and a big smile."
15,September 1816,A letter has arrived from Colin Robertson today saying that Lord Selkirk will make sure that we are able to return to The Forks.
05,November 1815,"Now that Kate is living in the same hut as us, it is my responsibility to make sure that she does her share of household chores."
05,November 1815,"In order to cheer up the older children, some of whom were without their parents, I led them in song around the campfire."
12,June 1816,But there was more gunfire and then his voice fell silent.
12,June 1816,Robbie finds this all very exciting and wants to go and fight.
12,June 1816,“I have just now learned of my father’s death.
10,April 1816,"If she is such a savage, why is she so nice?"
05,November 1815,Some of our party were already staying in storage sheds.
05,November 1815,"But he’s ten, I reminded myself, not a child."
18,December 1816,Robbie and his friends have built a snow fort and they meet there daily.
11,May 1816,If the fireplace is deemed to be built correctly we can move into our new cabin within days.
07,January 1816,James made me a beautiful little necklace that he whittled from wood and tied on a piece of sinew.
02,August 1815,"“And nor shall we be, Father.” “Don’t worry, Father,” Robbie chirped."
05,November 1815,He thought I had done very well and I promised that by the morning the whole family would have moccasins.
07,January 1816,The stick was around 3 feet long and curved at one end.
02,August 1815,This evening Father came into the room with a grim look on his face.
11,May 1816,But let me tell you a little of that trip back to our new home.
15,September 1816,"But it was so beautiful to drift out into the water in a canoe, passing through the tall grass, the warm sun streaming down."
05,November 1815,"I could write no more last night, still feeling exhausted and weak."
09,March 1816,I suspect it was only her manner that reassured him — perhaps she said something about her brothers and how they have survived worse than this.
12,June 1816,"She has just been told,” Father said."
03,September 1815,And they are not the only ones.
15,September 1816,Then one of the women came by with a birchbark basket.
10,April 1816,"Father asked many questions, and they were happy to answer them."
05,November 1815,"We would be split into two groups, those walking behind the Red River carts, which were filled with goods, and those in the boats."
05,November 1815,Somehow Kate and her father have ended up with us.
05,November 1815,"She pointed out that there were some very good-looking young men in our party, especially my own brother James."
12,June 1816,Very shortly we saw the Governor’s party advance.
01,July 1815,"Don’t be dreaming of servants and an easy life, my little Isobel."
09,March 1816,I went outside with her and gazed at the sky.
02,August 1815,"Will we give up so easily?” “Mother would never be so quickly defeated,” I said, putting on a brave face in an attempt to follow James’s example."
01,July 1815,"That’s also why she taught you all that fancy needlework.” “And how to pour tea like a lady, and how to walk straight and tall as if balancing a book on the top of my head,” I added."
02,August 1815,I cannot express my feelings when we disembarked from the small schooner.
06,December 1815,And they will share their hunt with us if we help the way we did the last time.
05,November 1815,"Whenever Father went on one of his rare visits to town in the old country, he bought second-hand books for us, and every night we would take turns reading to one another."
03,September 1815,(This gave Robbie relief almost immediately and I am very grateful.)
14,August 1816,As did Kate.
05,November 1815,Much to my dismay I quickly noted that Kate was also in our boat.
04,October 1815,What a relief to be able to rest.
10,April 1816,The ceremony was held outside.
07,January 1816,"The men had just finished a successful hunt, and the women had finished their work on the buffalo."
11,May 1816,"Father hopes he will finally authorize Mr. Robertson to take Duncan Cameron to England for trial on the grounds of treason, using those dreadful letters threatening the colony as proof."
09,March 1816,And is that a good or a bad thing?
10,April 1816,"I thought they would be bloodthirsty killers, not to be trusted, but they are not that at all."
04,October 1815,It is getting too cold at night to write and has been too wet.
12,June 1816,How could this happen?
05,November 1815,He stopped at a thicket 30 to 40 feet in diameter.
05,November 1815,Snow began to fall.
07,January 1816,Finally she was able to steal the balls from me and her team passed them back and forth between them until they reached the tipi at the far end of the clearing.
18,December 1816,I did not realize how deeply my feelings went until I heard this news.
12,June 1816,"The men are meeting, led now by the Sheriff, Alexander McDonell."
05,November 1815,"The other families were not yet here, so we settled into various huts, where we immediately made fires and then hot tea."
03,September 1815,"He makes sure we eat every drop of the stew we are offered — even Robbie, who swore he would never touch the stuff the first time he smelled it."
15,September 1816,"Bends Fingers ran into our cabin calling out to us, “Wind, wind, follow me, follow me.” Kate had gone to the river to help White Loon with the laundry and I had stayed to clean fish for our dinner."
04,October 1815,It has become very cold at night.
02,August 1815,"I cannot wait to set foot on land, and yet I am nervous about what is to come."
14,August 1816,And then they end up with names like Bends Fingers!
05,November 1815,We sang “The Bonnie Banks of Loch Lomand.” Later This is a long story.
07,January 1816,Time went so quickly that as the sky began to darken I realized we had spent the whole afternoon playing and that I could not remember a time when I had felt my blood pump through my heart and body with such a feeling of well-being.
05,November 1815,"Most of the boxes and trunks had to be left behind, as the fathers who had been rowing found themselves carrying their children instead."
11,May 1816,White Loon has made a salve and that helps.
12,June 1816,"White Loon was no doubt correct in that Kate was perhaps trying to behave, or was behaving, as an annoying little sister."
09,March 1816,All celebrations are forgotten.
02,August 1815,"The mournful sound of the pipes went right to my heart and I felt I was leaving Mother behind, as well as the country that had been as a mother to me."
16,October 1816,Our old home might now be overrun by sheep so that we cannot farm.
01,July 1815,"Mind you, I’m not sure any of us understands."
12,June 1816,Then I stopped and turned to White Loon.
15,September 1816,Father has managed to get flour and a small bit of sugar from the Company and I will also make a cake.
10,April 1816,Everyone danced.
03,September 1815,Today the hunters shot seven geese and I can smell them cooking as I write.
05,November 1815,"I tried to tell Father that we would be better off with another family, but he would hear none of it, saying that we were lucky to share with only two instead of a family of five."
15,September 1816,White Loon and Father gave Robbie his very own bow and arrow.
05,November 1815,"Such a long and difficult trip, only to discover home is still beyond our grasp."
02,August 1815,"But Mother brought us all up to be unafraid, and even though a little part of me trembles, I must pay no mind."
03,September 1815,I made the mistake of shrieking when one crossed my path as we were walking.
12,June 1816,"I will always take care of you and your family.” “Your brothers have come looking for you,” Father said to White Loon."
12,June 1816,They were to be taken to Fort William.
05,November 1815,"We are ensconced in the main building at Fort Douglas, in a small room."
03,September 1815,Father told us that a fur trading ceremony was about to occur.
02,August 1815,I refused to allow that to happen; it would have given Kate too many opportunities to torment me.
10,April 1816,Robbie and James stood with Father.
02,August 1815,"I myself am not sure exactly why this has happened, but it has."
05,November 1815,"“Look,” James said, pointing at his feet."
05,November 1815,The pemmican was gone.
05,November 1815,"Why are you not walking?” “I have little Robbie to care for,” I informed her."
05,November 1815,They skinned the buffalo and hung the skins over tree branches.
11,May 1816,It seems that we have certainly gained another family.
07,January 1816,Hogmanay turned out much better than I would have imagined.
05,November 1815,They continued to talk as we walked and I’m sure it made the time go quicker and took their minds off the dreadful cold.
05,November 1815,"“You cannot accuse him of whining — not with the difficult journey they had.” Peter went on to tell us that they had had to winter where they’d been left, and then in the spring had to walk all the way to York Factory."
04,October 1815,The landscape has changed greatly.
03,September 1815,"First the Indians were offered bear steaks, some liquor and some small trinkets."
11,May 1816,"“Of course he hasn’t,” James replied."
12,June 1816,He must be mad!
11,May 1816,Do I not still want to become a lady?
02,August 1815,They worry we will drive the buffalo away.
04,October 1815,"It seemed like a gift from God as we sat and rested, instead of tramping over the dangerous ground."
05,November 1815,"I can imagine myself reading this to Robbie’s children one day, and them laughing at their dear dad."
10,April 1816,"That is enough.” “I have a mother,” I grumbled."
12,June 1816,"“My name is Archibald McLeod,” said a stocky man with a very large voice."
03,September 1815,"Mine have not swollen as badly, but the old ones seem to itch as violently as the new ones, until I feel like one huge itch."
10,April 1816,The entire day went by as if I were in a dream.
03,September 1815,"I took a step toward her and almost slapped her, only stopping when James caught my wrist."
07,January 1816,"She pointed to her hands and said, “No.” Then she pointed to her feet and said, “No.” Then she motioned for me to come and join her group."
04,October 1815,"My only consolation as I prayed for the safety of my family was that if we were to die, I would see you, Mother, all that much sooner."
05,November 1815,They’re called Red River carts.
09,March 1816,But on the final day Leaf Bud gave me a piece of the hide so I could make a skirt from it.
12,June 1816,They began to rummage through all of our trunks.
11,May 1816,“Father loves White Loon.” “Why did he stop loving Mother so quickly?” I asked.
03,September 1815,As for me I think about the buffalo.
12,June 1816,We were stopped by a group of Nor’Westers today.
12,June 1816,“Thank you.” She smiled and her whole face brightened.
13,July 1816,Jack River House is on an island only a short row away.
07,January 1816,"In the meantime the women help with cooking, and Kate, Alice and I are sent out to dig up clods of grass and frozen buffalo turd, which is used in the fire."
17,November 1816,"James is also very good, and much to Alice’s dismay, James and Kate spend all their free time rehearsing."
18,December 1816,So farewell for now.
12,June 1816,"They ransacked the Post, forcing all the families to take shelter with the Cree Indians."
14,August 1816,I don’t think I understood properly anything about our coming to this New World.
02,August 1815,When the storm was finally over we had to clean up the mess.
11,May 1816,"I have never wanted to complain in these pages, especially as I feel I am writing to Mother as well as to myself, and I wouldn’t want to blame Mother in any way for leaving me in charge, but it has been difficult taking care of Father and two boys all by myself."
05,November 1815,Then the snow came again.
02,August 1815,"“I merely said hello,” I retort."
03,September 1815,This has been a welcome diversion as we wait for our guides to ready the boats.
18,December 1816,An extra benefit is delicious rabbit stew.
05,November 1815,"We were finally ready to go on the morning of our second day, the thirteen families that had remained, and our entire group."
03,September 1815,But now I really must take my leave.
15,September 1816,Peter is jealous and is now begging his parents for one as well so he can go hunting with Robbie.
05,November 1815,I promise.” The necklace was in a small bag of belongings that had not yet been put back on the York boat or the cart.
05,November 1815,"The party could not ready itself in time to leave today, so we leave tomorrow at first light."
12,June 1816,"And to what do we owe the pleasure of your company?” At this Archibald McLeod’s face grew very red and he exclaimed, “We will search all your belongings, sir.” Sheriff McDonell made a small low bow."
05,November 1815,Father says there might be trouble with provisions for the winter.
03,September 1815,I was thrilled to be able to observe this event.
12,June 1816,“Where have you been?
09,March 1816,"It was dried by the fire for days, and again the smell was overwhelming."
08,February 1816,They often seem to be about animals.
03,September 1815,Father tells me to ignore her and will not let me retaliate.

18,December 1816,"Father and many of the other men are to go back to The Forks before the ice breaks up so they can plant crops in the spring, and we are to join them in the summer when all will be made ready for us."
15,September 1816,James is fashioning him a bracelet.
03,September 1815,We are warned that it will become much worse.
12,June 1816,"And what an unusual number of events, both amazing and frightening, then ensued."
05,November 1815,We leapt onto the dock as our boats pulled in.
17,November 1816,Kate continues to surprise me.
10,April 1816,"Father tried to speak to me many times over the last few days, but I had nothing to say to him."
03,September 1815,"Kate, as she always does, was walking just behind me."
09,March 1816,Afternoon We have been reading from the Bible and praying.
02,August 1815,"It’s true that our little house in the hills was small, but I always knew that if I felt shut in, which I often did, I could simply go for a long walk, something I did in all weather."
02,August 1815,Is life here on earth really good?
09,March 1816,Finally the door opened just a bit.
05,November 1815,And I also must think about Robbie’s education.
03,September 1815,"This morning I slipped on a rock and Kate, who is always nearby, grabbed me."
12,June 1816,"We saw their brigade boats coming toward us on the river, sails hoisted."
05,November 1815,I would not let him out of my sight.
05,November 1815,Little boys who ran into the enclosure took the intestines and threw them over the branches of the tree that had been left in the centre of the enclosure.
07,January 1816,"She then lifted the stick and threw the balls off the stick, forward."
02,August 1815,"These rooms are cold at night, because even though the days are still very warm the rain seems to trap the damp."
06,December 1815,"She has begun to spend time with me and White Loon, trying to learn a little of their language as well."
02,August 1815,"I remember he played his pipes as we left the port of Stromness, where we had travelled after Mother’s death."
11,May 1816,Father was able to begin ploughing right away.
11,May 1816,"Father and White Loon have returned and now, of course, White Loon is living with us."
09,March 1816,For days we rubbed until my hands were so sore it hurt just to open and close my fingers.
12,June 1816,Kate’s father is one of them and at least she can see him put in the ground.
10,April 1816,“I mean he is not happy alone.
07,January 1816,"She threw the balls onto the stick, then lifted the stick into the air to show how the balls balanced on each side."
06,December 1815,My entries into your pages have been shorter and shorter.
05,November 1815,I was also glad to see Robbie making a friend.
10,April 1816,And to James and Robbie.
12,June 1816,Very disturbing news today.
05,November 1815,"I have never seen Kate, or any young woman, dress herself so quickly and make for the outdoors — which I assume she felt was safe from the little ghosts."
01,July 1815,His eyes shone with excitement.
12,June 1816,We took our leave this morning and Kate wept as she waved good-bye to her brother.
09,March 1816,We were too worried about James.
03,September 1815,Then the actual trading began.
05,November 1815,"Then the little girls of the village ran to the shaman’s tipi, bringing wood."
09,March 1816,My only wish is to have James home safely.
03,September 1815,"But they also trade in black bear, fox, wolf and more.” I found it so interesting and pictured the wealthy people of England walking around in the very furs being traded today."
05,November 1815,"This chute was at least a mile long, or so James told me — he helped build the entire structure."
05,November 1815,"My skirts dragged, often catching on bushes or brambles."
07,January 1816,"White Loon seems surprisingly sensitive to my state of mind, and right from the beginning has made an effort to soften the effects of her mother’s orders."
06,December 1815,Father says we  have to leave Fort Daer and follow the Indians in order to survive the winter.
02,August 1815,"Just to think this might be blasphemous, and yet how can one explain such pain?"
09,March 1816,"He and White Loon’s three brothers, Fire Owl, Jumps and Small Beaver, all decided to go out on their own for a hunt."
03,September 1815,He raised his knife and a cold chill ran down my spine.
11,May 1816,We take mud from the river and slather it on.
12,June 1816,We’re all very worried.
12,June 1816,“The letters?” I breathed.
15,September 1816,I know this weighs heavily on Father and on James.
06,December 1815,The wind blows through the cracks in the logs that are filled in only with clay.
10,April 1816,I never thought I would see him laugh again.
05,November 1815,"“My mother died too, but she was buried in the ground."
02,August 1815,The roof has been leaking terribly ever since it started to rain.
09,March 1816,But the temperature has plummeted and my skin began to freeze after only minutes.
11,May 1816,Father is smiling and making jokes.
02,August 1815,"“I am not frightened,” I said, “of anything.” The sailors had descended to the iceberg by rope ladders."
12,June 1816,As we drew parallel to them they called to us to stop and demanded that we put to shore as well.
09,March 1816,Small Beaver was also affected and could not see.
05,November 1815,"I have begun to read the Bible aloud at night, at least as a way to keep up our tradition."
05,November 1815,"That night we snuggled together under blankets in the tent, along with Kate (whose devious pranks seemed to diminish the more it snowed and the colder she got) and a number of other children."
05,November 1815,I treasured it more than anything — anything except Robbie’s health.
11,May 1816,"We also have to check for wood ticks every night and then White Loon burns them off with a small branch she sets on fire, and blows out just before sticking it on a creature."
18,December 1816,Father was right not to give up hope.
05,November 1815,“My father … my father … looks after himself.” She raised her eyes defiantly.
02,August 1815,"After all, I cannot write every single detail of every single day."
12,June 1816,"In a low voice Father said to us, “They are looking for the correspondence that Colin Robertson obtained when he captured Duncan Cameron."
06,December 1815,Father is disgusted by the Hudson’s Bay Company’s poor foresight.
03,September 1815,They sound like something out of mythology.
01,July 1815,"He said to the doctor, ‘Doctor, will I be able to play the bagpipes after my arm has mended?’ ‘Of course you will, man,’ the doctor snapped."
16,October 1816,I am too busy writing our theatrical to also write in your pages every night.
07,January 1816,"I hope, Mother, that you will not disapprove too much, although I fear that you will."
02,August 1815,"“I dare you, Little Princess,” Kate said to me."
04,October 1815,It is another Hudson’s Bay Post.
15,September 1816,The husks blew away in the wind and only the rice remained!
05,November 1815,“This group had to go all the way back north to Jack River.
15,September 1816,"We did this all afternoon until my arms felt that they were going to fall off, but in the end I was given an entire basket full of rice to take home."
05,November 1815,"“Isobel,” he called back."
09,March 1816,But last week the weather was too snowy and wet so it was hung inside the tipi.
15,September 1816,Father and White Loon will not say what their present will be.
16,October 1816,"As for me, I think it delightfully appropriate that Kate play the villain."
05,November 1815,"Robbie became pale, and he shivered easily as he had no food inside him to keep him warm."
05,November 1815,"“Don’t worry, Isobel,” he said."
02,August 1815,"Kate is never far behind them, taunting under her breath with rhymes like: “Roses are red, violets are blue, the waves crash about us, and I love you.” She is merciless in her teasing and the poor young couples can find no peace from her."
03,September 1815,When we reach our final destination of the day we are given tents to set up.
05,November 1815,Tears came to my eyes.
12,June 1816,Were we about to be attacked?
13,July 1816,He feels that this will give Lord Selkirk time to place us back in the Red River Settlement.
14,August 1816,"Father made two sets of bunk beds, one for me and Kate, the other for Robbie and James."
18,December 1816,Lord Selkirk is to make a treaty with Chief Peguis and the Indian bands and both “chiefs” are very proud.
10,April 1816,Alice sits with me constantly and lets me talk and talk.
05,November 1815,"“Why, you look quite green!” She laughed as she worked away."
15,September 1816,"(Speaking of dreams, I have suffered the most terrible nightmares since that dreadful day.)"
07,January 1816,They called to one another and taunted the other team.
12,June 1816,"So are the others with him.” “Kate’s father is one of them, I fear."
05,November 1815,"Some of the bushes seemed to have less snow on them than others, perhaps after Robbie had rustled them, but we could not see his footprints."
02,August 1815,We are finally free of the ice!
12,June 1816,“Is Father amongst them?” I whispered.
11,May 1816,"They are nasty, as they dig right into your flesh."
06,December 1815,"And even though we still have some of the meat the Indians shared from the hunt, it will not be enough to last us the winter."
04,October 1815,Clean clothes.
05,November 1815,It was pitch black and I could see nothing and yet I knew right away that Robbie was not there.
11,May 1816,"And as before, I loved the feeling of being good at something and the generous way the other girls applauded my skill."
05,November 1815,"We threw down our work, grabbed our shawls and ran with the rest of the settlers to the place of the pound."
15,September 1816,They played games all afternoon.
05,November 1815,The river had frozen during the night and the boats could go no farther.
03,September 1815,I cannot say I like the look of those York boats — they seem very open to all the elements.
07,January 1816,"You always wanted me to behave like a lady, and you prized that above all else."
07,January 1816,The roles of our family became clear the first day the women of White Loon’s family set up their large tipi.
16,October 1816,Father says the number is well over ten thousand.
01,July 1815,"If that doesn’t prevent them from being sick, I’m not sure what will!” I smiled a little through my tears."
01,July 1815,I remember that day.
18,December 1816,The thermometer is registering at minus thirty-five degrees.
17,November 1816,I will only be able to write short passages from now on.
02,August 1815,"We were in Helmsdale, ready to embark on our voyage, and suddenly with no warning she became ill."
12,June 1816,She tells me that you have offered to do so.” He paused and looked questioningly at Father.
07,January 1816,"Just as she was raising her stick to throw the balls, I looped them off with my stick, turned and threw to White Loon’s mother, Leaf Bud, who ran with them to the tipi, scoring once again."
09,March 1816,"In a way I am glad to be back to the relative comfort of Fort Daer, but I already miss the fun we had living with the Indians, if not the backbreaking work."
15,September 1816,"Soon we were being taught how to do it as well, and although sometimes I dropped some of the rice, I quickly learned."
11,May 1816,"Robbie spends all his time with his friends, playing, and no time at all with his studies."
12,June 1816,My heart was in my throat.
02,August 1815,Fortunately Father saw none of this.
05,November 1815,"And that brings us up to the present moment, waiting for our families to join us."
03,September 1815,"Apparently the most plentiful furs are beaver, marten and muskrat."
10,April 1816,Father intends to marry White Loon!
16,October 1816,And then what?
16,October 1816,The weather has warmed a bit.
12,June 1816,"Unfortunately I have signed a contract with the North West Company for another two years, and will not be able to leave to take care of her."
11,May 1816,James laughed.
05,November 1815,"“It’s not very different,” she said, “from the way we used to make it in the old country, except here we use deer instead of sheep.” Alice, her mother and Alice’s older sister Bettie began to prepare the haggis as I looked on."
05,November 1815,"I suspect there were very few other families, poor tenant farmers, who behaved in such a way, but Mother never let us forget that she came from the gentry."
03,September 1815,The terrain is quite flat.
17,November 1816,"Certainly it has given us a diversion, but I could have wished for a more relaxed diversion than this!"
05,November 1815,"I smiled and said thank you, and she mimicked my words and said thank you, but with such a funny accent I had to laugh."
07,January 1816,We were not dressed for the weather.
10,April 1816,He said we could teach them.
16,October 1816,I have decided to put on a theatrical for the entire group of settlers.
12,June 1816,He spoke quickly with White Loon and by the expression on her face I knew that the news must be bad.
16,October 1816,"We work day and night gutting them, cleaning them and drying them for the winter."
11,May 1816,I have not described our little bit of land here.
12,June 1816,"I had been planning to write in your pages, dear diary, but White Loon convinced me to take you with me, so I could sit under a tree by the river and write there."
05,November 1815,"On the rough wooden dock, waiting for us, were thirteen families — the only settlers who had not been driven away by the North West Company."
03,September 1815,"I am not a squeamish person, but one thing I cannot abide, and that is a snake."
18,December 1816,"It seems she has managed to save both me and my brother, so I must note that Father made a good and wise choice."
03,September 1815,"He is a tall man whose name, according to one of our Métis guides who speaks English, is Running Fox, and he looks a bit like his name, having a sharp nose and a thin face, and he moves quickly as he goes about his duties."
09,March 1816,I know one thing to be true.
13,July 1816,"Of course, I believe Father to be the most sensible of all men, and would like to believe that he is correct, but I fear that he is only fooling himself."
12,June 1816,There were approximately forty or fifty men and they flew the new Métis flag — a square of red with a figure eight lying sideways in the centre.
05,November 1815,I was given a small sharp knife that had probably been obtained by trading furs.
09,March 1816,He threw his weight against it and so did Kate’s father (who had managed to spend two days with us without saying more than two words).
08,February 1816,"At the end of the slope are small holes, around twelve of them."
15,September 1816,Both White Loon and Father were very proud of me and delighted with my acquisition.
10,April 1816,He says that soon we will be moving back to The Forks.
12,June 1816,Apparently the Indians say there is a large group coming down the Assiniboine with the sole purpose of destroying our colony.
07,January 1816,And Robbie gave me a big kiss.
17,November 1816,Snow covers the ground.
11,May 1816,Poor Robbie is quite covered in bites.
03,September 1815,And when James drank it his fever dropped in almost no time!
08,February 1816,We stood there as long as we could until the cold drove us back to the warmth of our tents and blankets.
03,September 1815,One of the Indians motioned me over as I was bathing James’s brow with cool water this evening after we camped.
12,June 1816,"I clearly heard the Governor’s voice as he begged for his life, saying he was not mortally wounded should they fetch the surgeon."
11,May 1816,“He will always love Mother.
13,July 1816,"She blushed and thanked him and now James, too, is collecting rocks, and busy on his new design."
02,August 1815,"Everywhere I turn there she is, always with an irritating word."
01,July 1815,"“I have met with a fellow who represents the Earl of Selkirk,” he said."
16,October 1816,Again I am impressed by these so-called savages.
02,August 1815,"“Merely,” she says, eyes rolling upwards."
05,November 1815,Perhaps I should have tied a cord between us so that he couldn’t wander off by himself.
14,August 1816,"I couldn’t help but wonder at such interesting names, and asked them how they got them."
02,August 1815,I steadied my voice.
10,April 1816,On the basis of these letters Robertson arrested Duncan Cameron there.
11,May 1816,He is a Métis leader and a member of the North West Company.
06,December 1815,I think it was because he was angry but unable to think why.
05,November 1815,I covered him up with blankets as soon as he was inside the tent.
02,August 1815,"“Your mother gone, and we headed to such an uncertain future.” “Ach, Father,” James said, throwing back his shoulders, “is that the attitude of a Highlander?"
05,November 1815,"Kate, surprisingly enough, seems to like to be read to, although she would never admit such a thing."
06,December 1815,"There are some mutterings amongst the men that the Company never meant to support us at all, and that they regret giving Lord Selkirk the land."
09,March 1816,His eyesight was almost gone and Jumps was leading him.
02,August 1815,Jasper McKay is playing his bagpipes and some of the men and women are dancing.
06,December 1815,"Father believes it is a humiliation we should not have to suffer, but he also believes it would be foolish to stand on pride and starve to death here in Pembina."
15,September 1816,Bends Fingers has promised that we can help harvest the rice with them over the next few days and that then we shall have a part of it.
05,November 1815,“I do have the necklace you made me last year.” James could see my distress.
03,September 1815,"I was nervous, as I know the Indians are savages, but I noticed Kate smirking at me so I held my head up and walked over to where the Indian stood, knife in hand!"
12,June 1816,I could not see who had fired first.
10,April 1816,I will ask Father.
09,March 1816,James had become friends with these three boys just as I had become a friend of White Loon’s.
05,November 1815,Perhaps she would like a necklace even better than Running Fox would.
02,August 1815,I cannot.
13,July 1816,Or about our future.
05,November 1815,That’s because they had to invent a way to build them without using nails.
02,August 1815,"I must repack all our belongings for the next stage of our journey, so I am washing and mending as quickly as I can."
05,November 1815,I cooked bannock and tried to get the small children settled under big buffalo robes and blankets.
05,November 1815,Kate seemed so thankful for a decent meal that even she managed to keep quiet for the most part.
13,July 1816,It is a tiring and long process to travel so near the banks where we cannot use the gusts of wind to push us ahead.
12,June 1816,So the Sheriff has sent a message surrendering the Fort.
03,September 1815,I cannot wait to see these beasts.
03,September 1815,"He walked over to the kettle and pointed to the water, as if I should throw it in, which I did."
09,March 1816,No change.
03,September 1815,I think he would be far warmer.
15,September 1816,Won’t White Loon be proud of us when we come home with rice for the winter?
09,March 1816,He looked back at me and shook his head.
01,July 1815,"I pictured us living in a grand house in the New World, with servants to wait on me and young men coming to call."
15,September 1816,"The time has passed so quickly and so pleasantly that there have even been a few nights when I have not suddenly wakened, gasping for breath, reliving over and over that terrible day at Frog Plain."
05,November 1815,"One day it warmed up, which at first we believed to be a welcome relief, until the snow turned to ice and it became dangerous to set one foot in front of the other."
08,February 1816,It seems our entire family has some kind of talent in the games.
02,August 1815,I know that I wrote little on our trip.
05,November 1815,I sit by the fire and on the rough wooden table is a cruisie lamp which gives me just enough light to see these pages.
05,November 1815,I reminded myself that the savages are probably like children and must be treated kindly.
07,January 1816,"I think back to that reckless act on the ice floe when I behaved in a very unladylike way, and I wonder if I did not start down this dubious path then."
08,February 1816,No one steals the balls from me.
05,November 1815,"We ate partridges that had been cooked in a pit, making them tender and juicy."
05,November 1815,"I was glad he had his blanket pinned about him, as a cold north wind was blowing harder by the minute."
09,March 1816,She’s more worried about his ears and has told us that the white means that they were frozen and he must always keep them protected from the cold from now on so as not to develop an infection.
09,March 1816,He was carried into the hut by Black Bear just as evening drew near.
14,August 1816,"They did not speak to us at first, but I knew from meeting with White Loon’s people that that was not because they were necessarily unfriendly, it was just their way."
05,November 1815,The weather has turned bitter and I can see he is worried about how we will survive.
01,July 1815,"James, being such a good older brother, tries to cheer him with his never-ending wit and humour, but all his attempts seem to fall flat."
12,June 1816,She nodded and pulled a packet from beneath her dress.
10,April 1816,"“Frankly,” Father said, “I believe Colin Robertson has a better idea of the politics and the dangers that we are encountering than Governor Semple does."
05,November 1815,I could not really see beyond this so I was anxious to go exploring.
03,September 1815,"Father was off hunting in the woods, as were most of the men."
01,July 1815,Father sits listlessly on his bunk all day.
02,August 1815,Robbie is particularly bad at that and I often hear the workers bellowing at him to make way.
12,June 1816,"This is a terrible outcome, as Colin Robertson seems to be the only sensible person here."
05,November 1815,“Do you have anything you can trade for them?” James asked.
02,August 1815,I had no idea how vast this land was and the distances we would have to traverse.
01,July 1815,We would meet secretly when the family went away and we could walk together and talk.
05,November 1815,Perhaps James is right and Robbie needs to become stronger.
02,August 1815,"James strode in behind him, and even Robbie looked up from the small wooden boat he was playing with, sensing that something was wrong."
06,December 1815,"I, too, feel bereft."
09,March 1816,Just behind them were a number of the men from the Indian band.
02,August 1815,And then she died.
09,March 1816,They were sure that is what saved their lives — a few hours or even minutes of warmth.
13,July 1816,"The Factor in charge of the Hudson Bay Post at Jack River is called Bird, James Bird."
12,June 1816,"We will not budge from here easily, not by the sound of the men."
09,March 1816,"The storm blew in a few hours later and now we are shut up, trembling at its power."
05,November 1815,Kate’s father is a sullen man who barely speaks a word.
16,October 1816,"One drawback — they are very light and easy to tip, nothing at all like the York boats that we travelled on more recently."
15,September 1816,Robbie’s birthday is tomorrow.
18,December 1816,Lord Selkirk was in Montreal when he heard of our trials.
05,November 1815,It would be easy to get lost then.
10,April 1816,He confiscated all the correspondence he found there.
03,September 1815,"There are the yellow jackets and big wasps, and always the danger of tipping over one of their nests and disturbing them."
05,November 1815,"Typhus, it was."
12,June 1816,“It is too dangerous.
04,October 1815,"Ever since we left the comfort of Oxford House days ago, the wind has blown cold in our faces, the rain fell, the boats struggled to stay upright and we did not know if each moment would be our last."
05,November 1815,"“And I have myself to care for,” she retorted."
18,December 1816,I miss writing in these pages.
05,November 1815,I regretted terribly that the Indian girl who had promised to help me make moccasins was walking behind us with the other group.
09,March 1816,"James did notice the sky was beginning to darken, and he believes Small Beaver did as well, for he spoke to his older brothers about it, but they were intent on the hunt and did not listen."
09,March 1816,Quickly it was no longer a choice — I simply had to get used to the smell.
02,August 1815,What astonishes me is that Father tells me our journey could take two months or more!
12,June 1816,"We were close enough to see Governor Semple’s face go all red — furious, most likely, that a man not of his station could speak to him in such a manner."
10,April 1816,Meanwhile James is in charge of the family.
14,August 1816,She is tall and beautiful.
01,July 1815,"She did take the good silver that she had been given from her father’s estate when it was liquidated, but only in case we needed to sell it at some point."
01,July 1815,“We will go on the biggest adventure of our lives.” At that she tossed the sewing that was in her hands up in the air and Father caught her in his arms and they spun around and around as if they could hear the music and they were dancing in a ballroom filled with candles and flowers.
02,August 1815,"And, of course, the longer we were stuck the longer the voyage would be."
05,November 1815,"You and Father baby him far too much.” Robbie is ten years old now, that is true."
05,November 1815,When this was done the crying man gave each little girl a small piece of heart fat and each little boy a piece of buffalo tongue.
09,March 1816,And they will be able to travel on their snowshoes.
01,July 1815,The boat was rolling quite a bit — the wind was up.
09,March 1816,It was then that the brothers realized that they had to get back to camp.
09,March 1816,"And, of course, Kate and her father are living with us again, and Kate is as bothersome as ever."
14,August 1816,"I wonder if I were to change my name, what I would change it to?"
14,August 1816,We danced for hours.
15,September 1816,We were unable to celebrate last year as we were on that difficult long trip from York Factory.
10,April 1816,"(Have I mentioned, dear diary, that Fort Gibraltar was the North West fort near Fort Douglas, also at the junction of the Red and Assiniboine rivers?)"
03,September 1815,The boats are then placed on log rollers and pulled by rope.
12,June 1816,"We set off in eight boats, taking what little we were able."
12,June 1816,Governor Semple has ordered Fort Gibraltar to be stripped and the palisades floated downriver to be used to protect Fort Douglas.
08,February 1816,We all followed him outside.
08,February 1816,"“Ghost dancers,” White Loon said."
18,December 1816,We start on it tomorrow.
11,May 1816,"“You are behaving like a child,” he said to me."
11,May 1816,I have had to converse with White Loon.
05,November 1815,We slogged our way through the snow.
03,September 1815,"As happy as they were to row these huge boats, they are unhappy during this stage of the trip."
01,July 1815,"They warn of all sorts of trials in Rupert’s Land.” “I don’t give a trifle for that,” I scoffed."
01,July 1815,"Of course, I was sorry to think of leaving my friends, but in a way I had known all along, my whole life, that I would be leaving."
11,May 1816,By the river are the most beautiful willows whose branches reach all the way to the ground.
05,November 1815,They were laden with goods.
15,September 1816,The rocks around us were covered in bright orange moss.
01,July 1815,"This afternoon they spotted whales, and all the young people crowded the railings to get a good view."
05,November 1815,But there was no reply.
03,September 1815,Father says we  leave as early as tomorrow morning!
05,November 1815,"There was little food and the children were depleted from the long, cold, dreary walk, but finally we arrived here at Pembina and the fort, Fort Daer."
05,November 1815,Robbie’s boots had no holes but they were worn and not as easy to walk in as moccasins would be.
01,July 1815,He speaks to no one.
05,November 1815,They shot the beasts and one by one they fell.
09,March 1816,Next the hides needed to be tanned.
03,September 1815,We are up every morning by 7.
01,July 1815,"I feel so lonely without Mother, and now, in a way, without him."
12,June 1816,"But we still have to be outdoors all day working, so it is nerve-wracking to say the least."
02,August 1815,"I would breathe deep of the smells, flowers and trees, and sometimes I would run, just to feel the wind against my face."
03,September 1815,"Father says it is called tundra, but we are warned that it will soon become more rugged and more difficult to traverse."
09,March 1816,"I hated to worry him, but I had no choice."
02,August 1815,There will be three weddings before we leave.
02,August 1815,Yet it seems to be constructed in a way that assures the heat will go straight up the chimney.
10,April 1816,The Indians tell tales of such a thing and seem quite fearful of it.
13,July 1816,"And just in time, as my other one is literally in tatters."
05,November 1815,How can I do justice in these pages to the magnificent beasts and to their noble hunters?
09,March 1816,"We ate, but said little and spoke little."
12,June 1816,I will not be afraid!
12,June 1816,"“But just like Kate, you are welcome with us.” He paused."
05,November 1815,"Behind it came others, some pulled by the men of the colony, some by oxen."
02,August 1815,The Métis are descendants of French and Indian.
05,November 1815,I ran to find some of the men who had been rowing the boats.
12,June 1816,Beyond our hiding place were numerous tall oak trees in full leaf — the reason the place is called Seven Oaks.
05,November 1815,"“Aah,” he smiled."
12,June 1816,Beyond that is a small open space called Frog Plain.
05,November 1815,"“How do I look?” he crowed, showing off his new trousers."
13,July 1816,It is a transformation I would not have credited even weeks earlier.
09,March 1816,It was dark and a wind was blowing up from the north.
10,April 1816,You are still young.
01,July 1815,"I have been asked to be an assistant, since my English is so advanced compared to the rudimentary English of most of the others on the ship."
10,April 1816,I barely know how to write this or what to say.
01,July 1815,"“It isn’t easy, though.” “McTavish broke his arm,” James said, with that serious look on his face that meant he was about to tell another joke."
05,November 1815,"And then, in the silence of the night, because the snow makes everything so quiet, I heard him crying."
03,September 1815,He wore a magnificent headdress of brightly coloured feathers.
09,March 1816,"But when he went to open the door it would not open, not an inch."
03,September 1815,"We are beginning what is called a 
portage
 where the boats are moved by land, as there is no possibility to row them any farther in the water."
12,June 1816,White Loon pulled me down beneath a large willow tree.
10,April 1816,Why am I — and Kate — the only one who thinks this is so wrong?
05,November 1815,Without Mother’s cheerful optimism and fearlessness it is harder for him not to doubt his decision to bring us all here.
15,September 1816,"The mosquitoes are almost gone, now that it is well into ."
02,August 1815,"As we settlers have been put in cramped bunks in the forward hold — a dank, dark and cold place I have come to dread — we are trying to spend as little time as possible down there."
01,July 1815,"It was cold and a hard rain fell, but we felt like it was the sunniest day there had ever been."
02,August 1815,I don’t know how to answer him.
02,August 1815,"I immediately took a turn around the Fort, which is constructed in an unusual octagonal form."
01,July 1815,"He nodded and then without another word got up and wandered off, seeming to forget all about me again."
05,November 1815,"“They are much easier to walk in and they are warmer than our boots.” I looked down at my worn boots, one of which already has a hole in the sole."
01,July 1815,"We packed our warm clothes, shawls, stockings, gloves and sturdy boots."
09,March 1816,The sun hurt my eyes so much at first that I could barely see.
12,June 1816,“Are my brothers safe?” I gasped.
02,August 1815,And every minute I became more and more aware of how close the quarters are until at times I felt I would certainly faint.
02,August 1815,"So, naturally, I worry over Robbie and try to keep him from any harm at all."
06,December 1815,"James was gone all day, hunting."
05,November 1815,"Kate, under my strict supervision, was mending socks, grumbling incessantly about how boring it was and how she should be out hunting buffalo."
02,August 1815,"The doctor in Helmsdale told us that her blood had become infected from a cut — we all remembered that she had cut herself on the trunk as we were packing, days earlier — and there was nothing he could do for her."
01,July 1815,There is talk that soon everyone in the Highlands will have to leave because the land is to be given over to the sheep.
12,June 1816,He says there is a heavily armed party of Métis and some Indians that will be here within two days.
12,June 1816,William spent evenings with us by the fire.
05,November 1815,"“It will be good for him to get out and hunt.” I sighed and bit my lip, and tried to think what you would do, Mother."
18,December 1816,I no longer care about being a fine lady.
07,January 1816,I looked at her and decided she would not have them for long.
02,August 1815,"Still, I am not sorry that little Miss Annoyance should see that there is nothing she can scare me with."
02,August 1815,"As best as I can tell, they see us settlers as a direct threat to their company."
05,November 1815,"We became weaker by the day as we subsisted on a watery stew of roots, some sort of wild turnip."
09,March 1816,I realize I have not written very much in these pages about James and that I have been terribly remiss not to do so.
06,December 1815,"The Indians are travelling farther south, tracking the buffalo."
10,April 1816,After the celebrations had been going on for a while White Loon and Father left for a short trip away on their own.
01,July 1815,‘Really?
18,December 1816,They captured Fort Daer in Pembina and then recaptured Fort Douglas!
05,November 1815,The snow has melted again and the Indians near us are going on a buffalo hunt.
13,July 1816,"I have not been writing because there is little to report and I am working with White Loon on my skirt, which is now almost finished."
02,August 1815,The longer we are on board the more closed in I begin to feel.
04,October 1815,"It could take us weeks, they say."
01,July 1815,"Remember, we will not own the land right away; we will have to work for it.” “I know that, Mother,” I assured her."
14,August 1816,"They could, of course, have shooed us away, but it did not seem that even occurred to them."
12,June 1816,"So I held her hand and we ran along the river, travelling to the Fort that way rather than along the road."
07,January 1816,"All I had was my tartan shawl wrapped around me, my warmest dress and my woollen stockings, but it was hardly sufficient against the bitter cold."
18,December 1816,"She is the queen of the settlers for the moment, and even when she is not immersed in this activity she appears to be a new person — not soft, but with a cutting sense of humour that does not hurt others, but is still sharp and keen."
12,June 1816,"“You have no choice but to adhere to a contract,” Father said."
12,June 1816,We had no choice but to follow their orders.
05,November 1815,Apparently the young men have ridden off to find the herd.
08,February 1816,I have not been writing because when the days are clear and there is no wind I have taken every opportunity to play.
03,September 1815,"The men used a tree branch to set it, but then Justin’s older brother Evan had to pull him on a makeshift stretcher."
02,August 1815,They are called country born.
12,June 1816,We were by a bend in the river.
02,August 1815,"He seems a cultured man, and Mother had told me that she had often read articles written by him in the 
Edinburgh Times."
09,March 1816,"Quickly they pulled down branches from the trees and stoked a fire, but within hours the wind had picked up to such a degree the fire could not hold."
02,August 1815,Robbie has to guess which child it was and then say how far the child must run.
12,June 1816,"All Mother’s dreams for us, all the hardships we have endured — all for nothing?"
05,November 1815,"“I feel so foolish,” he whispered to me."
02,August 1815,They do not want a settlement right in the middle of where they hunt for buffalo.
11,May 1816,And is giving in and liking her just more of what Kate keeps taunting me about — am I becoming a savage myself?
18,December 1816,I believe that Mother was right.
01,July 1815,"“Oh yes, and he was distraught."
01,July 1815,"“Have I told you, Isobel, how your mother and I met?” I have heard it numerous times, of course, but was so happy to hear Father speak at all, I simply said, “Please tell me, Father.” I put down my sewing and waited while he settled himself beside me."
12,June 1816,But Governor Semple will not allow us to and insists that we stay on the land and continue to farm.
13,July 1816,"Tonight it is calm for the moment, but the clouds refuse to go away."
05,November 1815,"(And dear diary, so did I, although I never would have complained and worried Father.)"
05,November 1815,I noticed that Robbie’s face was becoming red and sore.
10,April 1816,"I almost think that if I do not write it, Mother will not find out, but I know that you are looking down, Mother, and that you already know."
12,June 1816,"“I do not see him,” she answered, “but I see Kate’s father, and Alice’s father too.” A man rode out from the trees where they had been waiting on horseback and called to the Governor’s party, “What do you want?” “What do 
you
 want?” the Governor called back."
01,July 1815,Robbie is lost without Mother.
11,May 1816,"There are trees, naturally, which break up the vista, but I can sense the expanse around me."
09,March 1816,Kate is past annoying.
09,March 1816,I would not have known it was morning except for the fact that I could see a little stream of light coming in through the cracks in the wood.
10,April 1816,If we cannot trust the judgement of our Governor there is reason to worry.
01,July 1815,"Just when I think I am getting better, I find myself suddenly and unexpectedly weeping."
10,April 1816,Evening White Loon and I had a long talk this afternoon.
05,November 1815,Now you go right to sleep.
11,May 1816,What would happen if I did question her organization of the household?
09,March 1816,This was allowed to set and then packed again in hides.
05,November 1815,Once the buffalo are in the chute the hunters make large motions to scare them into moving forward.
11,May 1816,Robbie is riding back with one of White Loon’s brothers.
10,April 1816,"“Do you mean you won’t marry him after all?” She shook her head, obviously searching for words."
12,June 1816,James takes part in the deliberations with the older men.
12,June 1816,But let me go back a little and relate the terrible events of the last few hours.
03,September 1815,He feared his settlers would starve without enough pemmican.
13,July 1816,Since Robbie’s Indian friends are no longer here he spends more time with Peter.
10,April 1816,“He doesn’t need anyone else.
11,May 1816,I must admit that already she is taking a large burden from me.
02,August 1815,Of course I have never been closed in before.
05,November 1815,“The voyage was very rough.
11,May 1816,"White Loon’s brothers have been helping us, and once the chimney is finished we will finally be able to move in."
05,November 1815,I think the hardest thing to convey is how strange and different everything is.
01,July 1815,"And I could not help but think of Mother, who will never reach the Promised Land, just as Moses was kept away by God himself."
05,November 1815,"“Perhaps they are little ghosts,” I said to her, almost positive it was not true, but unable to resist trying to frighten her."
11,May 1816,"We went to the Company store, set up temporarily in a room in the Fort, and were treated terribly."
02,August 1815,"I try to keep him near me, but I am too busy myself."
02,August 1815,"As the time dragged on, I became more and more aware of the other settlers — one in particular who is past annoying, Kate McGilvery."
09,March 1816,It is my birthday.
03,September 1815,I try very hard not to respond to her.
12,June 1816,"Father muttered under his breath, “We should have stayed where we were protected."
09,March 1816,"Indians were travelling on snowshoes, but each time Father took a step he sank well over his knees, sometimes up to his waist, and had to be pulled ahead by Black Bear."
15,September 1816,She is making us winter jackets from caribou skins she has managed to obtain from the Indian women by trading some of our pots.
12,June 1816,Just as we were pulling it in she motioned me to stop and put her fingers to her lips.
12,June 1816,I myself do not know what to do.
10,April 1816,I spoke to White Loon.
01,July 1815,A more different man than the one I see before me I cannot imagine.
05,November 1815,It seemed after a while that we would be travelling forever and never reach our destination.
05,November 1815,"At the same time the settlers’ crops were burned, as were their buildings, and the people were threatened."
02,August 1815,"All we have given up, only to find our destination in ruins?"
06,December 1815,Perhaps it is not good company to keep.
03,September 1815,I should describe a little about our camp.
07,January 1816,Father gave me ink he had bought at the Fort.
07,January 1816,"White Loon’s family consists of a grandmother and grandfather, her mother and father, three brothers and a younger sister close to Robbie’s age."
12,June 1816,And now I vow never to think badly of her again.
10,April 1816,"But this confuses me, just as my time with the Indians was confusing."
05,November 1815,"In fact, the reason they had come to the New World was because of the urging of relatives who had come before."
14,August 1816,Bends Fingers came to get us and showed us where the best patches were.
09,March 1816,She says that his blindness will disappear.
07,January 1816,"The women were moving to the centre, chatting and laughing."
05,November 1815,But I had no time to worry about Kate.
05,November 1815,"They are all, according to the settlers who have been here longer, very friendly and helpful to us."
15,September 1816,They were each holding a large flat piece of birchbark.
06,December 1815,Perhaps they hope to starve us out!
05,November 1815,The floors are bare earth.
05,November 1815,"“He isn’t strong, though,” I objected."
10,April 1816,As I was sitting with Alice at her hut sewing I overheard her mother and father talking about the North West Company and their plans to drive the settlers away from The Forks again.
05,November 1815,“It was a terrible sight.
11,May 1816,"I saw a beautiful red-breasted bird, and there were many red-winged blackbirds, as well as yellow finches, meadowlarks with their beautiful song, and bluejays with their striking markings and horrible squawking."
14,August 1816,"In a way, then, the settlers are simply pawns between the Hudson’s Bay Company and the North West Company."
09,March 1816,I sit by the fire and wait.
08,February 1816,"“No, no,” Father corrected her."
03,September 1815,"And I know, Mother dear, that you would not allow me to utter a mean word no matter what the provocation."
05,November 1815,“Robbie!” I shouted.
13,July 1816,"Actually we passed through here on our way to Red River, but the leaves were already off the trees by then, although I remember the tall and magnificent spruce, tamarack and jack pine."
03,September 1815,"Good posture is no help on this trip, is it?” I think she did it just so she could lord it over me and continue with her ceaseless teasing."
07,January 1816,I noticed that Kate was already with the other group.
05,November 1815,Mrs. Connor then invited our entire family and Kate and her father to eat with them.
05,November 1815,"If Kate dislikes me so, why is she always hovering about me?"
09,March 1816,"The women and girls work very hard when the buffalo first come into camp, and we settlers were put to work right along with the Indian women."
07,January 1816,Our team began with the balls on our sticks and the other team tried to pull them off our sticks with their own.
12,June 1816,"Just then more Métis rode in from behind the Governor’s party, so they were cut off and surrounded."
12,June 1816,I write with trembling hand.
12,June 1816,Suddenly the Governor reached out his hands and grabbed the reins of the other’s horse.
15,September 1816,I love the Indian way of life.
18,December 1816,"Because they are not savages at all, but good people who have different ways than us."
13,July 1816,Dreadful weather.
10,April 1816,At night the Indians would sit around the campfire and tell stories.
06,December 1815,We will be lucky to have any kind of meal.
01,July 1815,"And then we can build a grand estate, the envy of everyone.” At the same time, I was sorry to say good-bye to Helen — it is hard to part from your dearest friend since childhood."
09,March 1816,I shall try to write down as closely as possible James’s account as he described his harrowing adventure.
05,November 1815,Then they began to scrape the hides.
10,April 1816,"“No, you are my sister,” he said."
05,November 1815,One of the men picked him up and carried him back to the campsite.
12,June 1816,I finally pushed White Loon’s hand away in time to see Alice’s father and another man I did not recognize running low to the ground from tree to tree so that the Métis would not notice them.
01,July 1815,"This morning I taught the Bible class, as Mr. McBeth has become ill."
02,August 1815,"I nursed her and tried to cool her fever, but it was fruitless."
09,March 1816,If I had not known there was a settlement around me I could never have guessed.
07,January 1816,When the men returned with the buffalo they were put to work cutting and hauling wood.
14,August 1816,"In this ceremony a group of birth songs are sung to the child by the father or by the shaman, before a gathering of family and guests."
05,November 1815,I shall sleep well tonight.
10,April 1816,How would we defend ourselves?
05,November 1815,"There was fresh bread because some of the grain had been salvaged from the vicious attacks; there was wild rice, which has an almost nutty flavour."
14,August 1816,And the Métis see us settlers as a threat to their way of life.
03,September 1815,The rest of us walked.
03,September 1815,But we try.
08,February 1816,"Robbie ran out of the tent after pulling on his moccasins, and then ran right back in again."
06,December 1815,Did I mention that Pembina is the name the Indians call the berries that they add to the pemmican to flavour it?
05,November 1815,In the morning we would do our chores.
16,October 1816,"I know that Mother would be pleased as it is another way to develop my writing skills, and a more public way, since this diary is to be read by no one but myself."
05,November 1815,"Miles Macdonell has built a fort there, Fort Daer, just for the settlers."
12,June 1816,She came back shaking her head with worry.
11,May 1816,"As we talked I remembered our friendship, and my heart softened toward her just a little."
11,May 1816,"She often walked with Alice and me, teasing me and taunting me about White Loon whenever she could, until I found myself defending White Loon and Father."
05,November 1815,"I felt like crying, but I remembered that Mother was not there and Father was not there and James was not there and that I was in charge of Robbie and that I had to calm myself and try to find him."
02,August 1815,“Merely.” As if uttering that word alone is some sort of crime.
09,March 1816,"While I have tried to take on Mother’s role, in many ways James has taken on Father’s, for Father is often too sunk in grief to do the things a father normally does."
01,July 1815,"But we could not marry, being of such different stations."
05,November 1815,Each day blended into the next as we trudged through the snow.
01,July 1815,“I do too.
17,November 1816,She has a flair for the dramatic and is the best player we have.
10,April 1816,That means us.
06,December 1815,"Her face is so smooth and pretty that she seems no more than my age, but I now realize she is a developed woman."
12,June 1816,“Jumps is inside.
16,October 1816,"Already James, Alice, Kate, Robbie, Peter and Bends Fingers have said they wish to participate."
09,March 1816,"The storm worsens, if that could be possible."
09,March 1816,"He does not like to fight, that is sure."
11,May 1816,"“Oh, you’re too young to understand.” I am not too young!"
18,December 1816,"All the settlers celebrated together, but no one knows what the New Year will bring."
05,November 1815,I noticed that Kate would not dance.
03,September 1815,"The light is gone by the time camp is set up and it is not easy to write by the fire, although I will attempt it if I cannot ever write in daylight."
09,March 1816,"The wind did not hold steady but picked up and dropped off, and whenever possible they started a fire."
01,July 1815,I was destined for a better life.
10,April 1816,When I got home later I questioned Father about all of this and asked him why he had not told us anything.
10,April 1816,I could not.
15,September 1816,BIG NEWS!
07,January 1816,"In fact, I am in general rather confused."
02,August 1815,"“Ooh, doesn’t she speak fine!” Kate crows."
11,May 1816,"Even when we walked the girls would play — they would just pick any target, a bush or tree, and see who could hit it with a stick."
10,April 1816,At night I read to him rather than write in your pages.
10,April 1816,"He also wants to unite the camps of Fort Douglas and Fort Gibraltar, and he wants us to remain at one of the Forts and not go back to the land."
11,May 1816,"Jumps took Robbie on his horse, and James was able to travel with Small Beaver."
07,January 1816,Jasper McKay played his pipes and everyone sang “Auld Lang Syne.” We will leave soon to follow the Indians farther south.
05,November 1815,The men drank far too much and James was quite sick later on that evening.
07,January 1816,"There was no wind, and although the temperature was very cold it seems that one can be outdoors as long as the bitter wind is absent."
09,March 1816,The wind continues to howl.
08,February 1816,"“It is 
aurora borealis.” It was beautiful and I was in awe at the sight."
05,November 1815,All the young children were placed in the boats since they could not possibly walk so far.
05,November 1815,"I had to almost sit on Robbie, as he is too young to be wielding such sharp blades, but he managed to scramble away from me and helped the other young Indian boys drag the bushes once they had been cut."
05,November 1815,"Many times, Mother, you told me of your mother and her sixth sense."
02,August 1815,There are even some men who are descendants of Scots and Indians.
05,November 1815,The men have time to do no more.
18,December 1816,"Today Lord Selkirk met with us on Frog Plain, the site of our tragedy, and made us a gift of the land and wiped clean our debt."
12,June 1816,“William!
09,March 1816,"And some boys think he is less of a man for it, but I think he is more of a man."
12,June 1816,Without speaking to me she ran to find Father in the field.
11,May 1816,I am covered in bites.
12,June 1816,"“It is my brother!” And then I remembered that she did have a brother working for the North West Company, although she rarely spoke of him."
07,January 1816,I cannot believe how far from my dreams we have sunk.
10,April 1816,In Cameron’s correspondence he discovered letters from the North West Company urging the Métis to attack all of us.
09,March 1816,"There is a thaw in the weather appropriate to the first day of spring, and I find myself quite comfortable wrapped in my tartan shawl."
02,August 1815,I must not dwell on these feelings because that will only make things worse.
12,June 1816,But I reminded myself that Mother always taught me to be unafraid and I determined that these murderers would not make me cower for one more minute.
05,November 1815,"For a moment I forgot that she was a savage, for she seemed a girl just like myself."
09,March 1816,Father went to fetch her in the hope that she could help James.
09,March 1816,They were not looking for buffalo but rather for deer and to set traps for rabbits.
06,December 1815,And we shall be following the Indians.
07,January 1816,But to the point.
09,March 1816,But our work was not over.
11,May 1816,I  have to speak to him.
11,May 1816,I often find myself just standing and looking out over the prairie where we will soon finally have our home.
11,May 1816,"It would be rude to do otherwise, placed together like this for hours on end."
06,December 1815,It will soon be New Year’s.
12,June 1816,“Unfortunately I do not know where we will be.
05,November 1815,I was startled and gasped.
05,November 1815,"And it is from our new little hut, dear diary, that I write to you now."
05,November 1815,"It seemed that he and probably the rest of us were suffering from some kind of a snowburn, which must be similar to sunburn."
05,November 1815,We were told that we would be at The Forks within days.
02,August 1815,"So you see, dear diary, that we go forward to an uncertain future."
01,July 1815,“The Hudson’s Bay Company has granted this land to Lord Selkirk and your father says that it is not to be all smooth sailing.
12,June 1816,"“Kate has told me how well you have taken care of her,” William said to us, “and I find myself forever in your debt.” He looked very distraught."
05,November 1815,"The hunters were only finding small game, not nearly enough to feed such a large group."
03,September 1815,"The boatmen put pemmican in a pot, with some water and whatever roots they can find."
02,August 1815,"Anne McKim is the plainest young woman I have ever seen, but a gentle spirit with pleasing manners."
09,March 1816,When the meat was finally dry we tied it up and stored it in rawhide sacks.
13,July 1816,"I never had a chance to make myself that skirt out of the hide I was given by Leaf Bud, but now in the evenings White Loon is helping me."
12,June 1816,"Alice weeps constantly, as does Kate, who will not leave my side, but I will not!"
11,May 1816,First the framework was built of branches.
05,November 1815,“And where would your father be?” I asked.
01,July 1815,I read from Exodus.
10,April 1816,You work hard all day.
06,December 1815,"She is called White Loon, which I think is a beautiful name."
14,August 1816,What a prickly girl she is!
15,September 1816,I think it will snow soon.
03,September 1815,"I was wondering when the trading would begin, or was the trading just everybody giving everyone else gifts?"
01,July 1815,"And in a way that was a lucky day for me, because she became a governess in a big house in the south of Scotland, where I was working in the stables taking care of the racehorses."
12,June 1816,It seemed there were about twenty men with him.
05,November 1815,"I told the men that perhaps he had done that and so we hurried back to my tent, the men holding up burning logs from the fire so we could see."
14,August 1816,When we returned with our strawberries White Loon showed us how to press them into cakes.
13,July 1816,Last night a tree right beside our tent was split in two and set on fire.
07,January 1816,It was our team’s turn again.
12,June 1816,They seem to have decided to defend Fort Douglas.
05,November 1815,"Father says they are Cree and that the band we met at The Forks is called the Saulteaux, although there were Cree there, too, as well as Ojibwa."
02,August 1815,My heart is fluttering like a newborn chick getting ready to be pushed from the nest.
07,January 1816,There were times when I felt so cold I almost wept.
05,November 1815,"Winnipeg means muddy water, and the Red River certainly has a muddy look."
05,November 1815,“You didn’t know how to find your way.
05,November 1815,I shall endeavour to find this out.
14,August 1816,We then left them out to dry so they could be put away for the winter.
12,June 1816,We must leave today.
05,November 1815,"So Father and the other men have to build enough huts for everyone, and even then we will have to share."
04,October 1815,"But soon we will reach a place called Oxford House and today we were back in the boats, crossing Holy Lake."
09,March 1816,We almost froze even with the fire going all night.
05,November 1815,I have been so exhausted every evening that I have been remiss about writing in your pages.
12,June 1816,I began to feel the ground rumbling.
05,November 1815,We would have to walk.
02,August 1815,And we play a game called tippy fingers.
04,October 1815,"The leaves are bright yellow with an occasional dash of red, and today I look through them into the deep blue sky, a colour blue I have never before seen, and I feel we are blessed by God."
16,October 1816,I’m afraid that a couple of times James was so busy making a joke that he was not careful and he tipped the canoe.
07,January 1816,"It was obvious that we had to move the balls, but I had no idea where the goal was."
05,November 1815,"“As fine as the Indians?” “You look to me to be the finest young man in the New World,” I said, giving him a hug and kiss."
16,October 1816,Robbie screws up his face and pushes the fish around his plate.
01,July 1815,"“I know you miss Mother something terrible,” James said, patting my hand."
05,November 1815,A strange thing happened first thing this morning.
12,June 1816,"He couldn’t mean Fort Gibraltar — the North West Company fort — I thought, as that had been dismantled."
16,October 1816,Father insists that he eat and says that there’s no possibility of such preferences under these circumstances.
05,November 1815,"These they lashed together and made bundles, which were stacked about 30 yards apart from each other and about 4 feet high."
05,November 1815,And somehow she managed to get him to dance with her.
10,April 1816,"James has taken to sitting with us too, and Alice makes sure that she is very sympathetic to him."
10,April 1816,They will be back in two days.
01,July 1815,He could barely stand still.
03,September 1815,They call this rubaboo.
03,September 1815,"Father, who had questioned one of the Hudson’s Bay men, explained to me what was happening."
09,March 1816,I am determined to make up for the long absence in these pages and will try to be more dependable in my writing.
09,March 1816,By the time Black Bear found them James assured us he could not have taken one more step.
13,July 1816,We are hoping that when we arrive at Jack River we will be able to buy material.
05,November 1815,"“Our voyage was very, very rough and then the fever struck."
12,June 1816,As we pulled into shore she was one of the first to leap from the boat.
15,September 1816,He was so thrilled that I think he could not wait for the games to be over so he could go and practise.
05,November 1815,"Was your voyage rough?” he asked, but he didn’t wait for an answer."
05,November 1815,"Kate, who shares an oilskin with me on the floor, noticed and laughed at my fear, but when I challenged her she could not explain the cause of such a strange phenomenon."
02,August 1815,"Quickly, before anybody could say anything, I leapt onto the ladder and dropped myself onto the iceberg."
06,December 1815,I suspect the tents will be dark at night and during the day it will be difficult to write outdoors without my hand dropping off.
12,June 1816,There will be a brief service shortly.
02,August 1815,“What have I done?” he asked.
03,September 1815,It is not easy to take the time to write.
16,October 1816,It snowed today and the wind blew cold.
09,March 1816,"The smell is so strong that at first I had to choose between staying warm in the tipi, being alone in our own tent, or freezing yet being able to breathe outside."
05,November 1815,"Mother, you had bought it for me last year when I turned twelve."
11,May 1816,We leave in two days for The Forks.
08,February 1816,I must get to my chores.
05,November 1815,The hunters — knowing they will do this — use this tactic to make sure the buffalo go in the right direction.
13,July 1816,"We arrived this afternoon at Playgreen Lake, a most beautiful spot."
05,November 1815,James tells me that the buffalo will be here soon and that we will be able to watch as they are killed in the pound.
10,April 1816,I cannot wait!
10,April 1816,"It seemed at first that Duncan Cameron was amenable to his suggestions, but as the months went by that assumption proved to be untrue."
13,July 1816,"We cannot go into the open lake with our boats, as the winds are too strong."
18,December 1816,"Dear Mother, I pray that your vision for us will yet come true."
05,November 1815,I turned toward the sound and saw the strangest sight.
01,July 1815,And not always live in servitude.” Mother had laughed with delight.
03,September 1815,"I was forced to thank her, and she smiled in that annoying way she has and said, “Well, you are lucky I was there."
10,April 1816,Robbie seems unaffected.
10,April 1816,"There are still a few inches of snow on the ground, which proved beneficial for the ceremony because beneath the snow is only mud."
12,June 1816,It also occurred to me how fortunate we were that Father decided to come out of his grief.
03,September 1815,I am famished.
04,October 1815,We had a wonderful party last night where we ate and danced reels and jigs.
05,November 1815,We are to go south to a place called Pembina.
02,August 1815,I have found a copy of all the plays of Molière and all the plays of Shakespeare.
07,January 1816,"The entire group of settlers celebrated together, first in prayer, then eating four deer the men had managed to hunt over the last few days."
10,April 1816,She can actually make him laugh.
18,December 1816,– The weather is so bitterly cold it has become almost unbearable.
08,February 1816,"“Oh my, look at Little Miss Manners now!” Fortunately we are not living in the same tent as she is, but I see her constantly anyway, as she is always somehow nearby."
18,December 1816,"James must be covered up and I have sewn him a hood that covers his face and ears, leaving only his eyes and mouth free, otherwise he would freeze his skin again."
01,July 1815,"“Did he?” I said, trying to get into the spirit."
08,February 1816,"Sometimes it seems to be only harmless fun and nothing to be ashamed of, but at other times I know in my heart that it is wrong."
09,March 1816,James went out hunting with White Loon’s brothers.
09,March 1816,Evening No news.
14,August 1816,"We thought we’d come to this land to be free,” Father said, “but we are still being used by those higher than us.” Have had little time to write as every night we spend sewing and mending socks and underclothes, which are in a sorry state."
10,April 1816,"He is happy now, but why was I not enough to make him happy?"
05,November 1815,"I would not like to see her thrown to the fish.” “Three or four died and were thrown off the ship,” Peter continued."
14,August 1816,"A couple of them were girls our age, and they told me they were from the Swampy Cree band."
08,February 1816,"James is very good at driving the ball with his stick, which is what the men do instead of throwing it, but he is not as fearless as I and often has the ball stolen from him."
02,August 1815,"Well, I must admit that she got the better of me one day when I let her goad me into a rash act."
09,March 1816,Dread fills me.
13,July 1816,The clouds hover above us and lightning crashes around us.
18,December 1816,And Father promises me that he will order me another diary from England as soon as possible.
05,November 1815,"James has three times the learning of any of the other young men, because of our dear mother."
05,November 1815,I write now for the first time since we left The Forks.
05,November 1815,"“Ach,” she said, “listen to that boy whining.” “He is simply telling us what happened,” I objected."
10,April 1816,"Apparently Colin Robertson believes that when we return to The Forks we should stay at Fort Douglas for our own protection, but Governor Semple disagrees and believes we will be safe to go and farm the land."
10,April 1816,"“You are 
too
 good."
12,June 1816,They believed that Lord Selkirk’s settlement was established by the Hudson’s Bay Company to put them out of business.
10,April 1816,But what a shock to me.
05,November 1815,It is a mix of a Scottish reel and a Cree dance.
05,November 1815,"She wore a buckskin dress with beautiful beads sewn onto the front, a wide sash, and moccasins that reached all the way up her legs."
09,March 1816,The snow had drifted up to the rooftops in places.
09,March 1816,I made oatmeal for everyone.
05,November 1815,And yet the young men seemed to have no fear as they directed them into the corral.
05,November 1815,"I pointed to his clothes and then to Robbie, and shivered as if Robbie were cold."
05,November 1815,"I kept a tight hand on Robbie all the time, afraid that he would wander off and freeze."
12,June 1816,Father warns us all to stay near the cabin and to watch closely if we’re out in the fields or near the river.
14,August 1816,"I would be tempted to call them shy, but I have begun to realize that just because people behave differently than me doesn’t mean I understand why they do so."
12,June 1816,The women and children are still weeping over loved ones lost.
09,March 1816,"On that most difficult trip from York Factory it was always James who exhorted us to carry on, who tried to take our fatigue away by making jokes, and by kind words when they were necessary."
05,November 1815,"No, I shall wait for something better."
02,August 1815,Then another child touches Robbie’s finger with his own.
05,November 1815,Evening What excitement!
12,June 1816,"And then we saw an entirely new Kate, who seemed like a different person in his presence."
09,March 1816,"She hurried over to him and spoke softly and his face seemed to relax a bit, as if she had said something to make him feel better."
05,November 1815,"I am trying to establish some sort of order in our days here, as I’m sure Mother would have wanted."
02,August 1815,"But Robbie guessed wrong, which meant he needed to run the ten times himself!"
05,November 1815,"And then, dear diary, dear Mother, I got one of my feelings."
16,October 1816,Then they take the fibres of roots of the spruce and they soak them in water; when they’re soft they rub them until they’re so flexible they can use them just like thread to tie the canoe together.
05,November 1815,"I’m not sure what it was, but something woke me in the middle of the night."
03,September 1815,"As the weather cools off, especially at night, the mosquitoes at least are diminishing."
02,August 1815,"Of course, I saw him rarely on the ship, as he ate at the captain’s table, while we would be eating porridge in the hold."
05,November 1815,"The moon was behind the clouds, and away from the fire he would be unable to see a finger in front of his face."
07,January 1816,We were supposed to begin a life where I would be a lady.
05,November 1815,"Near evening we finished and the Indian women took the hides and stretched them on the ground, holding them down with stakes."
06,December 1815,How did they think we were to survive?
01,July 1815,"And also, I must admit, just to be with him."
11,May 1816,Today we built the chimney for our house.
12,June 1816,We travel on Lake Winnipeg to Jack River House.
08,February 1816,Even Father and James and Robbie took note as they watched some of our games.
06,December 1815,She has a calm and cheerful personality.
05,November 1815,Water must be lugged from the river.
10,April 1816,"“You are only children.” “But we deserve to know, Father,” James objected."
18,December 1816,"Mother, give us your blessing."
01,July 1815,"The companionship Robbie normally shares with Father is also taken from him, as Father is too sunk in grief to notice anything."
08,February 1816,He and Peter often play together and have become quite a team.
13,July 1816,But now these hardships are more difficult to tolerate and I find myself sunk in a black humour most of the time.
02,August 1815,I will make us rich in no time!” Even that did not make Father smile.
12,June 1816,"Father managed to find me ink and a pen, and my diary seems undamaged, which is fortunate considering that I was lying on it for so long."
15,September 1816,But I do not understand why that is so.
05,November 1815,We ran out of food.
08,February 1816,Robbie is patient and he concentrates fiercely.
09,March 1816,"She shrugged and said, “It will be bad.” I ran to find Father, who was just returning from a trip to the small store."
05,November 1815,"There are no books here outside of the Bible, and this is a great trial for me, and for James, who loves to read."
14,August 1816,They were wonderful about sharing the patches with us.
03,September 1815,"Such a profusion of dreadful creatures could not be imagined, and yet they exist!"
11,May 1816,And we have been building the new cabin.
12,June 1816,"Jeb Connor has just returned, soaking wet and telling terrible tales of a massacre.” I was happy to hear that Alice’s father had made it back safely."
03,September 1815,"No, there are the big horseflies that buzz around our heads, and if they can gain purchase either on our heads or anywhere on our bodies, will bite."
02,August 1815,She has taken to calling me The Princess or Your Highness.
09,March 1816,I now recognize how much I have taken his presence for granted.
10,April 1816,"It is true that some of the men have learned how to handle guns this winter when they were hunting, but they have never fought."
05,November 1815,"I put a solemn look on my face and said thank you again and she said thank you again, too, her happy smile returning."
01,July 1815,"That’s why Mother insisted that you speak English at home, not Gaelic."
12,June 1816,"“You took good care of me,” I said."
05,November 1815,"Father immediately tried to find us a place of our own, but there are too few huts."
05,November 1815,"It is up to me to make sure that this hut is clean, that the clothes are mended, that there is food to eat, and that Robbie is properly supervised."
11,May 1816,This hardens almost immediately and when we start a fire it will become harder and harder — as good as bricks.
09,March 1816,"“We will just have to wait patiently,” Father said."
09,March 1816,Alice’s mother has managed to make her way over here by one of the small trails the men have dug out in between the huts.
05,November 1815,Nothing is ready for us.
07,January 1816,Suddenly White Loon threw the balls and they landed on my stick.
05,November 1815,"It is true, I thought, he probably did simply go out to relieve himself and perhaps he would be back quickly."
03,September 1815,"The pemmican itself is made from dried buffalo meat, fat and berries."
05,November 1815,"There was such a hustle and bustle it was almost impossible to find anyone, but I managed to locate Running Fox, who had helped me before."
03,September 1815,Was he going to slit my throat in front of everyone?
01,July 1815,To start over.
05,November 1815,He was from one of the thirteen families that had stayed.
01,July 1815,"Your mother, along with her three sisters, was forced to find employment."
06,December 1815,I cannot bear to contemplate all the wonderful holidays we had together and then to compare it with our situation now.
05,November 1815,"Although I always dreamed of a better life when we lived in Scotland, everything was safe and familiar."
14,August 1816,One of the other girls is called Sings Well and the third is called Whose Face Shows Her Moods.
03,September 1815,"Naturally, every night the talk turns to what our reception will be and whether we will be safe."
07,January 1816,Thank goodness Robbie was more protected than I.
05,November 1815,I believe I was remiss and did not even mention his birthday in .
05,November 1815,"I could hear him singing, but I don’t know what the ceremony consisted of — praying for a hunt, I suppose."
16,October 1816,They use cedar for the frame and the ribs.
09,March 1816,"Weather has been cold, too cold to write."
10,April 1816,"We can now travel between huts, but we are getting very short on food because the hunters cannot get out."
02,August 1815,The settlement at The Forks has been destroyed.” I gasped and asked him how this could possibly be.
11,May 1816,"It took us two days at the store, going from one official to another and spoken to as if we were lowly servants, until we finally obtained the seed we need: beans, potatoes, carrots and turnips."
09,March 1816,And then there were sounds by the door.
05,November 1815,It was extremely delicious and there was almost a festive atmosphere in the little hut.
13,July 1816,"Also, Father was unable to take all of our clothes."
05,November 1815,"A man and a woman face each other, balancing up on their toes."
02,August 1815,"We were drifting by a huge iceberg, an iceberg so big that many of the men travelled from our ship onto it."
07,January 1816,The balls were connected to each other by a strip of hide.
05,November 1815,"She turned quite pale at that idea, then caught herself out and said, “That is just silly."
10,April 1816,It was a beautiful warm day.
05,November 1815,My cheeks began to feel almost numb.
05,November 1815,He was certainly not shy!
12,June 1816,“We were hidden under a willow right by Seven Oaks.
05,November 1815,I held out the necklace for her.
16,October 1816,This took them a few days but finally we had a lovely little canoe.
01,July 1815,"This is our chance,” Father had declared."
02,August 1815,"Mother always said, “God is good, kind and loving.” If that is so, why has God taken Mother away from us?"
11,May 1816,He still wishes to speak to me.
10,April 1816,"“But I am your mother,” I objected."
18,December 1816,A messenger has arrived with news so unexpected and so marvellous I have to try to stop my hand from trembling as I write.
07,January 1816,"Since it is the open plain they do not hunt the buffalo the same way as they did in Pembina, but rather race their horses beside the great beasts and shoot them with guns."
07,January 1816,"They began to pick up speed, running faster and throwing harder."
18,December 1816,I have only a few pages left and have been saving them for the day when we leave this land.
02,August 1815,"The ship’s cannon is firing as I write, to let them know that we have arrived."
09,March 1816,No news.
08,February 1816,Father seemed happy I was enjoying myself and did not seem to notice my unladylike behaviour.
18,December 1816,Our theatrical was a triumph.
12,June 1816,"“This is William,” she said, and then introduced each of us to him."
05,November 1815,"The temperature, rather than rising as it should be, seemed to be dropping."
02,August 1815,"I could not write, as we were trapped in the hold as the ship pitched and rolled in the most terrifying way."
03,September 1815,I have more socks to mend and I must do the final packing.
05,November 1815,"“Fifteen,” I answered."
12,June 1816,"John Pritchard was arrested by the North West Company, as was another fellow."
12,June 1816,"We are hungry, tired, dispirited."
12,June 1816,"“Yes,” Father agreed, “we have and are most happy to do so.” Well, I thought to myself, perhaps we are not 
happy
 to do so, but what else can we do?"
12,June 1816,"At that point she replied, speaking quickly, and then she seemed to crumple and he did put his arms about her."
05,November 1815,"So I gave it to Running Fox and he returned with trousers made from deerskin, which fitted Robbie perfectly."
18,December 1816,We will live free in this new land.
09,March 1816,I am sitting by the fire writing because I feel so helpless I do not know what else to do.
05,November 1815,The buffalo roam near there in the winter and we must follow them if we are to have enough to eat over the winter.” He shook his head.
02,August 1815,“I dare you to go across.” All the other children stared.
10,April 1816,“It will be up to them.” In the meantime he seems more worried about the Nor’Westers than these questions about the Indians.
09,March 1816,"And here despite the gravity of the situation James soon had us all roaring with laughter as he described himself blind and stumbling on his snowshoes, Jumps and Fire Owl mercilessly teasing both him and Small Beaver, probably to encourage them to go on."
01,July 1815,"And the Red River, apparently, is in a fertile valley, with a growing season long enough to bring in a good crop."
12,June 1816,She had to support me.
09,March 1816,White Loon came by our cabin and said there was a big storm coming and that she hoped the boys would be safe.
18,December 1816,"They proceeded directly to Fort William, where they took the North West Company fort from them in the dead of night."
05,November 1815,"“I wish I could have a pair, and Robbie and Father too,” I added."
12,June 1816,When he saw us his entire countenance was flooded with relief.
05,November 1815,"Sometimes you used to say that you thought I had inherited it, and other times you would say no, I had not, because I showed the signs so rarely."
12,June 1816,It is William!” “William?” I repeated.
08,February 1816,They believe that certain animals watch over them and guide them.
12,June 1816,"Speaking in a quiet voice William said, “I am so sorry for these unfortunate events."
12,June 1816,And then they were there — a band of men who looked like Indians to me because their faces were smeared with paint of the most bright and frightening variety.
07,January 1816,"White Loon ran to the group, picked up something and ran back to me."
16,October 1816,It would not be so difficult if we knew that we could go back to The Forks in the spring.
03,September 1815,A few Indians at a time went into a small room at the back of the Post.
05,November 1815,"Frankly, I should have been quite happy if she chose to do so."
12,June 1816,"“My brother,” Kate said, eyes shining."
02,August 1815,"Father says we are to go on big flat-bottomed boats called York boats, and are to travel south on the Hayes River, and then down the length of a very large lake called Lake Winnipeg."
01,July 1815,"I wasn’t frightened, not at all."
14,August 1816,"I am not sure if this is correct, but this is what I understand so far: The Hudson’s Bay Company gave Lord Selkirk a grant of this land."
04,October 1815,It has become so cold my hand cannot hold my pen.
18,December 1816,"When I go outside my nostrils stick together as I breathe, a most unpleasant sensation."
11,May 1816,"I concentrated on the wonders about me, walked with Alice, and tried to ignore my family as much as possible."
02,August 1815,For this long journey I must pack our belongings in waterproof bags.
01,July 1815,"“I fell in love with her the moment I saw her, and she loved me too."
05,November 1815,"This took almost the entire day, and almost all of the young men in our party joined in to help, in the hope that the Indians would share the hunt with us."
09,March 1816,After the meat was pounded to a pulp we added berries and then poured buffalo fat over it all.
11,May 1816,"The girls would stand a few yards back and throw other digging sticks, trying to get them to land in between the two sticks placed in the dirt."
05,November 1815,“Because the settlers have not had a chance to rebuild since the attack.
12,June 1816,"Kate shared her memories, we added ours."
18,December 1816,"And I even think that, Mother, you are probably thankful that White Loon has protected your children so well."
05,November 1815,"“We came on the ship 
Prince of Wales
,” he said in the funny little high voice he has."
15,September 1816,"I was horrified at first, thinking that he was being a bad boy and destroying the rice."
05,November 1815,I shook Kate awake.
13,July 1816,Kate is like a different person.
10,April 1816,"“I did not want to worry you,” he replied."
09,March 1816,Father could not survive one more loss.
11,May 1816,Father says he  as well still be back in the Highlands to be spoken to that way.
12,June 1816,They passed so close to where we were hiding we could have touched them as they ran past us.
12,June 1816,As all this was going on Kate brought her brother over to meet us.
10,April 1816,Too young to be a mother.
15,September 1816,I dare not believe that what the letter says is true.
05,November 1815,"I have never seen a buffalo before, and although I had been told that they were large, I never could have imagined a beast so strong, powerful and dangerous."
12,June 1816,I sit by the fire.
02,August 1815,And I was so thrilled with my daring and with the expressions on their faces that I began to dance and skip and generally show off.
07,January 1816,Play.” I was so surprised that I did not protest and went with her.
09,March 1816,They lay flat under the trees and covered themselves with branches for what little protection they offered.
05,November 1815,"I would not let her see me squirm, so I gritted my teeth and worked hard all afternoon."
12,June 1816,"Her cheeks grew quite red as her brother talked and she did not contradict him, so I can only assume that what he said was correct."
06,December 1815,"I am surprised because, as a savage, I expected her to be coarse and barbaric in her manners."
07,January 1816,The Indians will follow the buffalo and we will follow the Indians.
02,August 1815,"She is eleven years old, just a year younger than I am."
15,September 1816,My job was to catch the long stems of rice and shake them over the boat so that the kernels dropped into the bottom.
14,August 1816,"And the settlers are an obvious threat to those who work for the North West Company, because the Nor’Westers have been forbidden to take pemmican from the area, so that there will be enough for the settlers."
05,November 1815,I knew that the clothes we had with us would not protect us sufficiently on this trip to Pembina.
09,March 1816,Father wrapped himself in a blanket and went to join the men in order to dig out the other huts.
10,April 1816,Father told us more tonight as we ate our dinner.
12,June 1816,I can tell you that when the North West Brigade left for The Forks they did not do so with the intention of murder.
02,August 1815,I have never experienced this feeling before.
11,May 1816,She does not order me to do things.
11,May 1816,But I still cannot seem to accept Father’s betrayal of Mother nor White Loon’s new position in the house as wife and mistress.
05,November 1815,A Métis or Indian was in each boat as a guide.
15,September 1816,"It is nothing like the ladylike life I envisioned for myself, sitting pouring tea and eating scones with cream."
09,March 1816,"They were trying to make small trails from one hut to another, but they had to do it with their hands and the rough shovels that the Indians brought."
01,July 1815,We have sailed past Greenland and are heading into The Davis Strait.
02,August 1815,"She is a short, thin thing with dark eyes and dark hair — quite different from me, with my height, my hazel eyes and my reddish hair."
03,September 1815,"The Governor of Lord Selkirk’s earlier settlement, Miles Macdonell, proclaimed that no pemmican could be removed from the Red River Settlement."
17,November 1816,"I think it is unfortunate because Alice is such a mild soul who has a kind word for everyone, but Kate is bringing out the worst in her."
02,August 1815,"We are on the north bank of the Hayes River and the Fort is built on low ground, surrounded by stagnant water, which lets off a rather unpleasant odour."
16,October 1816,She says her brother told her many details that we  not know about the Company and that the Company is not all bad.
09,March 1816,"Even Kate managed to hold her tongue, perhaps realizing that no one would have patience with her today."
13,July 1816,We have set up camp on the bank of Jack River.
01,July 1815,"I remember the day, just after my twelfth birthday, when Father came home looking fit to burst, with the news that would change our lives forever."
08,February 1816,I have a moment on our first sunny day in a while — but only a moment.
14,August 1816,She showed us that she can bend her fingers all the way back because she is double-jointed.
09,March 1816,Could I wear it and not seem just like one of them?
05,November 1815,"At times all I could think of was my empty stomach, and I’m afraid I barely noticed my surroundings."
02,August 1815,They made them offers of land in Upper Canada and paid for their travel.
10,April 1816,I feel nothing.
06,December 1815,With no gloves I believe skin could actually freeze.
13,July 1816,"I think we are all trying to keep busy in some way or another, so as not to think about the dreadful events of the past few weeks."
06,December 1815,"Kate stays well away and makes endless comments when we are back in our hut, about fraternizing with savages."
12,June 1816,It was clever of the Sheriff to play on his vanity in such a way.
16,October 1816,It seems to me that we can devise a play and practise it.
05,November 1815,"I had the skins in my bag, but in the meantime my boots hurt and I could feel the cold coming through the hole."
03,September 1815,"There is a series of small falls and rapids, and since we are going against the current it has become too hard to row."
12,June 1816,I looked at White Loon in wonder.
02,August 1815,“I shall learn to shoot with a bow and arrow.
12,June 1816,He was a tall lanky fellow whose ears stood out quite remarkably from a long thin face.
10,April 1816,White Loon asked me to stand up with her but I refused.
11,May 1816,It has been raining for two days and we have been stuck indoors together.
02,August 1815,"I cannot help the fact that I hold myself well, that my dresses are well-made, that I speak English as well as Gaelic."
05,November 1815,"It appears that we will have to leave The Forks almost immediately, before it gets too cold for us to travel."
05,November 1815,“Have you seen Robbie?
18,December 1816,"And who knows, soon I might have a little half-Indian brother or sister."
16,October 1816,But the spring will bring only more waiting until a ship can take us home again.
05,November 1815,I hated to part with it.
14,August 1816,His ignorance helped him and those poor unfortunates walk straight into danger.” At that point a number of the women who had lost their husbands at Seven Oaks began to cry.
07,January 1816,Otherwise they try to manoeuvre them into snowbanks where they can be slowed down and more easily shot with arrows.
05,November 1815,George Dunn played the fiddle.
14,August 1816,Kate seems to have nothing good to say to her and in private only makes fun of her.
09,March 1816,James has slept and slept and has not yet been able to tell us what happened.
02,August 1815,"I have not mentioned her or written about her before in these pages, but I suppose I can talk or write about anything in this private book."
15,September 1816,Is it nine days since I last wrote in your pages?
16,October 1816,It seems that I can no longer look at them that way.
03,September 1815,As we’ve been travelling we have heard more news as everyone shares what they know when we sit around the campfire.
07,January 1816,"White Loon rushed into our tent, her eyes shining, her cheeks already red from being outdoors."
15,September 1816,It has become bitterly cold.
05,November 1815,"But every once in a while I would get a 
feeling
, and you had taught me to always listen to my feeling and to trust it."
11,May 1816,Land stretches out around me so that I could run for weeks and never have to stop!
05,November 1815,"We had no relatives there, but Father knew some of those who came from the Highlands."
11,May 1816,James has sat me down and given me a talking to.
02,August 1815,We have anchored at the mouth of the Nelson River.
09,March 1816,It is just that he is such a good brother that I have few complaints about him.
10,April 1816,White Loon has taken to coming to our hut at night so she can hear me read from the Bible.
05,November 1815,The men rowed hard all day with only a brief halt for lunch.
02,August 1815,My feelings of being shut up have been getting worse and worse until I was beginning to fear I could not bear another day.
05,November 1815,Today something called a chute was built.
12,June 1816,"“Now, while we have the chance.” When I stood my legs crumpled beneath me."
07,January 1816,"White Loon ran with the stick and balls to a tipi at the other end of the clearing, and by her whooping and yipping I surmised that we had now scored a goal as well."
02,August 1815,We are on land at last!
12,June 1816,"He helped her to a large log nearby and sat down with her, taking her hands in his."
06,December 1815,Perhaps one day White Loon will harm me in some way if I say or do something that insults her.
03,September 1815,"At that point the Indians and the Hudson’s Bay men sat in a circle, and a beautiful long pipe was lit by the man who looked to be the Indian chief."
03,September 1815,"Wish me luck, dear diary, on the next part of the voyage."
15,September 1816,I think that perhaps our dreams were destroyed at Frog Plain.
03,September 1815,"It is easy to pack and lasts forever and is very important to the fur traders, as it is their staple diet."
02,August 1815,He was playing near the fishing equipment and I insisted he stop.
10,April 1816,So Colin Robertson decided to seize Fort Gibraltar.
02,August 1815,I decided the best thing would be to walk.
12,June 1816,This morning Jumps rode up to our cabin in such a manner that my heart leapt into my throat.
05,November 1815,"I am sure Mother would want him to continue to study, just as I’m sure she would want me to continue to perfect the things she felt important."
02,August 1815,"“It is this feud between the Hudson’s Bay Company and the North West Company,” Father replied."
11,May 1816,(I will not complain again about how I long to be released.)
13,July 1816,"They returned with frying pans and kettles, blankets, flour, some oil, pemmican and some fresh fish."
16,October 1816,We must all help to bring in the fish.
13,July 1816,"She sits quietly, has not made a nasty remark all day, smiles occasionally, and even joins in the conversation."
16,October 1816,I cannot say I am looking forward to a long bitter winter.
09,March 1816,He will never show me the poetry he writes that I know he keeps secret.
12,June 1816,"“This is not an excuse for the violence,” he said, “but I offer you this as an explanation so you can better understand that all North West Company people, all Métis people, are not violent."
11,May 1816,"Oh, I am remiss!"
03,September 1815,What a devil that Kate is.
13,July 1816,"Although the other settlers seemed distressed by this news, Father is hopeful."
05,November 1815,"Ghosts are big and white.” “Maybe not in the New World,” I replied, my voice low and menacing."
12,June 1816,"I know that this is strange because I do not even like her, and although she sticks to me like a leech she does not seem to like me either, but who else does she have?"
02,August 1815,What an unexpected treat.
05,November 1815,"“No,” she grunted."
01,July 1815,"At nine years he is old enough to accept that she will never return, but not old enough to understand it."
02,August 1815,"We play hide-and-seek, of course, and that is by far the most popular game with the young ones."
05,November 1815,When we landed in Churchill the captain was so frightened of the illness and so anxious to get us off the ship that he would not take us to York Factory.
16,October 1816,Naturally we’re eating fish every night.
07,January 1816,"There was a fresh fall of snow on the ground from the night before, which twinkled and sparkled in the sunlight."
12,June 1816,"They ascertained which was Governor Semple’s trunk, broke the lock and thoroughly searched it as well."
12,June 1816,"In the meantime we were told by those in charge, very brusquely, to get out of the boats, to pitch our tents, and to bring all our belongings onto land."
13,July 1816,"There are also birch, poplars and willows that we are very familiar with from the Red River."
11,May 1816,"Mr. Robertson is still in command of Fort Gibraltar, the Nor’Westers’ Fort, and it seems he will stay there for the present."
11,May 1816,"Colin Robertson is the only sensible leader, and Father wonders what  happen without his good advice while he’s away in England."
12,June 1816,You will see only death.” She took my hand.
10,April 1816,He needs a wife.
14,August 1816,"Today we went berry picking again, this time looking for black currants."
05,November 1815,"So much has happened since my last entry, and weeks have passed."
12,June 1816,And then a shot rang out.
09,March 1816,Black Bear was among the Indians and I saw Father go over to speak to him.
13,July 1816,It was a miserable night.
10,April 1816,"“Now lad,” he said, “I know you will be tempted to run and play with your Indian friends, but you must not stray too far away from our land at any time.” Robbie grinned."
15,September 1816,But now that we are to go back to the Highlands how will we ever pay them back?
12,June 1816,"He put his hands on her shoulders and said something to her, which I could not hear."
12,June 1816,"“Yes,” said Father."
11,May 1816,Two digging sticks were placed about a foot apart.
05,November 1815,We were encamped in a small clearing surrounded by trees.
15,September 1816,The birds were singing.
10,April 1816,"He had the look of one who had no intention of 
not
 running and playing."
14,August 1816,"At one point Father said, “They probably understood that if we settled there we could easily supply the fur traders with food that we ourselves grew, and eventually that would make the Company stronger than the North West Company.” He went on to say that no one had thought about the new race of people coming from the marriage between Indian and French, creating a people who want to be known as a new people and new nation, the Métis."
12,June 1816,Another thought occurred to me as well.
03,September 1815,He has come down with a dreadful cold and chills.
05,November 1815,"He’s sure to turn up any second.” Of course, I thought, that must be it."
11,May 1816,Father and a number of the other men have gone to visit Colin Robertson at Fort Gibraltar.
12,June 1816,But Governor Semple has declined.
05,November 1815,And yet Peter’s family were simply too stubborn to leave with the rest.
11,May 1816,She also pointed out the strawberry plants and the raspberry and blueberry bushes.
10,April 1816,"James Sutherland, the Church elder who performed the first marriages, is to perform this ceremony before we go, so that White Loon will be part of our family by the time we return to The Forks."
07,January 1816,"I was terribly nervous about what to do, but I had to do something and so I bolted ahead."
05,November 1815,When we finally stopped for the night I was chilled through even though I had wrapped my shawl as tightly around me as I could.
05,November 1815,"There was no trail or path, so we followed the guides, trudging through the snow."
10,April 1816,But Robbie is not.
11,May 1816,"White Loon encouraged Alice and me to play, and as with the other games I discovered I was very good at it."
11,May 1816,Father is terribly worried.
10,April 1816,"The weather is warming considerably, but there is so much snow that no one wants it to get too warm too quickly, or we  find ourselves in the midst of quite a flood."
18,December 1816,White Loon is helping me make new rabbit mittens for everyone as Handsel Monday presents.
10,April 1816,"But Governor Semple disagrees, and will send us onto the land."
12,June 1816,"“We must go warn the men,” I said to her."
11,May 1816,"Sometimes I feel like running and running and running, my face in the warm wind, knowing that nothing will stop me."
12,June 1816,"I heard a splash of water, and saw that they were paddling toward the Fort, keeping close to the bank."
12,June 1816,"It is my own Company that has killed my father, and yet I am still contracted to work for them.” Father put his hand on William’s shoulder."
11,May 1816,But she will never come back.
16,October 1816,When it hardens in the cold water it appears to make a watertight seal.
16,October 1816,The theatrical has been put aside for the moment.
12,June 1816,"“I am, sir,” he said."
17,November 1816,I do not know what to make of her still.
05,November 1815,"At about midday I was mending a shirt of Father’s, sitting near the fire for as much light as possible."
05,November 1815,"“My brother Robbie is gone, he’s gone from the tent!” I cried."
08,February 1816,She is not to be got rid of.
15,September 1816,I will be telling her none of this as I want it to be a surprise.
05,November 1815,I found it and looked around for someone to trade with.
05,November 1815,I kept a tight hold on Robbie.
05,November 1815,"“Mother could not have done better,” he said to me."
09,March 1816,"Father said he would go ask White Loon’s father, Black Bear, if he knew anything about the hunters."
10,April 1816,I have been in a daze.
13,July 1816,"They are, at the moment, collecting small rocks from each spot where we camp, hoping to bring them back to Scotland."
09,March 1816,The boys knew that there was a small cluster of trees not too far distant and it was to this that they made their way.
05,November 1815,"The carts have huge wheels, which are made entirely of wood."
09,March 1816,The one I’d been wearing was in tatters and so it was a welcome gift — and yet was it?
05,November 1815,"“He will need to be strong,” James insisted."
09,March 1816,"Black Bear had brought snowshoes for them, but imagine how difficult it is to walk on them in the first place, and in the second place to walk on them without your sight."
12,June 1816,"William was then ordered to help with Mr. McLeod’s search, so he took our leave and went to his work."
05,November 1815,Two tall trees were left at the entrance and a log was secured between them at the same height as the wall.
16,October 1816,Then they select a birch tree and peel its bark off in one piece with a sharp knife.
11,May 1816,There is a natural windbreak of poplar.
05,November 1815,"After writing to you, dear diary, I joined the festivities in the Fort’s big room."
14,August 1816,We have built a fairly cosy little hut.
01,July 1815,Terribly upset.
08,February 1816,"It does not sound that different to me than our angels, except all the animals have such different personalities and are so vivid that it almost seems more exciting than an angel, who appears boring in comparison."
05,November 1815,She nodded and motioned for me to wait.
10,April 1816,It is true.
05,November 1815,The Indians have their camp very near to our small fort and it is here that they made what is called a pound.
06,December 1815,If we go with the Indians where will we live?
12,June 1816,What grief this is to bear.
13,July 1816,"Frantically we pulled our tent down and moved away from the fire, all the while being drenched by a mixture of hail and pelting rain."
12,June 1816,White Loon decided just after tea to go to the river to pull in her fish nets.
06,December 1815,"Dear diary, I do not know how much I will be able to write."
12,June 1816,I will not!
09,March 1816,Four poles are supported by a platform that is set up over the fire.
02,August 1815,The buildings are made of wood and are surrounded by a stockade.
03,September 1815,This combination keeps us dry and there are many blankets to keep us warm.
05,November 1815,"This is a sight, Mother dear, that would have thrilled you!"
06,December 1815,"And finally this afternoon she sat with me and, in exchange for a real needle instead of the bone she normally uses, she taught me how to make moccasins."
03,September 1815,"It has an odd taste, sometimes bitter depending on the roots, but Father assured me that it is nourishing."
05,November 1815,"If the herd goes off course, the hunters will veer their horses at them."
15,September 1816,Then the kernels were thrown into a big pit in the ground.
10,April 1816,“But what if they don’t want to be educated?” I asked him.
08,February 1816,To the sky.
14,August 1816,"It turns out it is not the least bit the same as how we get our names, with our mother and father telling us what it is."
05,November 1815,“I’m sleeping.” I pulled my shawl tightly around me and ran out into the night.
16,October 1816,If we can do a good job this theatrical can be played for generations to come to tell our story.
05,November 1815,But I want to record it here.
14,August 1816,"Often at night Father and the others, both men and women, gather round the campfire to talk."
07,January 1816,She was holding two balls made of deerskin.
12,June 1816,"Afternoon Cuthbert Grant, the leader of the Métis, has sent a message saying that if we do not surrender the Fort we will all be murdered!"
05,November 1815,Father and James were so happy to see Robbie and me.

09,March 1816,Late this afternoon the sky suddenly darkened.
09,March 1816,"Then we soaked it in water and rolled it all into a bundle, only to unroll it again, stretch it out and rub it with our hands."

14,August 1816,"The name can be based on physical characteristics or the personality of the child, or some event that might have happened to a child, or some animal the child is akin to, or even some war, or an event such as the weather."

05,November 1815,"I looked around anxiously to get a good view of our new home, but it all looked similar to the landscape we had just travelled, trees, bushes and shrubs near the river, tall grass and shrub farther on."
02,August 1815,Robbie has been very naughty.
12,June 1816,"It clearly shows the intent of the Nor’Westers to destroy our settlement, and would be damning in a court of law in England."
