ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I was certain a hundred Indians were watching my every move.

were
 presents!"
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",He banks it every night and covers the coals with ashes.

ch12,"September 6th, 1784",If there had not been so much to do today I warrant she would have been spinning away already.

ch9,"June 1st, 1784",I reached out to her but before I could say anything she gave herself a shake and straightened up.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I teased Hannah about it when we were eating our lunch but she blushed and got quite annoyed with me.

ch5,"February 1st, 1784","Laddie is curled up as close to him as he can get, and the smell of hot wet dog is pretty strong."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I’m sure the weather was never this dreadful back home.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","I asked him if he didn’t miss Albany at all and he just said, “Not a bit.” I don’t really believe him, but I guess he sure wouldn’t want to go back after having fought on the British side."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",People we used to call friends.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","Soon we will have a proper road joining us to the Rosses and then, I hope, we’ll get a road all the way into Johnstown."

ch7,"April 6th, 1784","There we will transfer into more 
bateaux
 and set off farther upriver."

ch3,"December 1st, 1783",It is my birthday today.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","It was sleety and rainy all last night, and this morning the snow was covered with a layer of ice."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Johnstown is no more than a collection of tents strewn along the riverside.

ch3,"December 1st, 1783",There was so much smoke it made us choke.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",The sound of the river is in my ears as I write and I can see the moonlight shining off its waters.

ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I am very very tired of being cold.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",What riches!
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",I think I will just lie here in the dark and remember every moment of the day and night.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Jamie has just come over to nudge me and get my attention.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",When she saw Angus I thought she would fall down in a dead faint.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",No one to tell me what is going to happen.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","It was Mr. Murchison, our preacher, and as it was Sunday, he held services with us in our house."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Poor Father.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He’s been letting us feed him by hand today, and I guess he’s finally decided we’re friends."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",She hasn’t stopped smiling since.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","“We must have good shelter and at least some food of our own,” he says."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Now if I could only go back to school I would be happy.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",As if I weren’t wet enough already.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","I was worried that Mittens might chase them, but she is afraid of them."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It is a wonder how a good meal and a full stomach can make a body feel so much better.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Except for the people who live here.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",There is definitely a mystery here.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Grannie is missing her spinning wheel.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",How I wish I could have knitted myself some new mittens.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I have never seen his face look like it did at that moment.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I suppose she does not think Hannah is any more ladylike than I am.

ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Only one blanket for every two children is the rule.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",My feet froze on the way to school today.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","There was no time to rest, though."

ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I will tell all about what has happened tomorrow.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He cuts balsam fir boughs for her every night to spread under her tarpaulin and make her more comfortable because, as she says, her “bones are old and sharp.” We just make do with blankets spread over tarpaulins laid right on the ground."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",She is too little to eat anything else.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","I am sitting as close to the hearth as I can, in my nightdress and well bundled up in my quilt."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","He’s supposed to measure 40 lengths exactly around the frame, but I can tell that he does not always count correctly."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I’ve never been on a boat.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","It was just a short respite before we were both called back to help with chores and minding babies, but it was enough."

ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","I found myself peeling the bark off the log, staring at it as if I’d never in my life seen a log before."

ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I didn’t have much of a chance to say anything.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","Dear Canada: With Nothing But Our Courage
April 1784
The quilting bee was yesterday."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","I suppose Duncan and Angus will go, though."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",It snowed all night and is still snowing.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",We are packing what little we have and this small cabin is in a turmoil.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Do you suppose we are being very sinful, dear journal?"
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","Finally, he had to have it pulled today and I have never seen a person go through such pain."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","There are several proper houses there now, as well as the church."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Fortunately, we have the quilts that we managed to bring with us."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",What a dreadful day!
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Mrs. Denny was shocked, I think, but Mrs. Ross, who was sitting with Mother, just smiled."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",They have been here for almost three years and are so well settled in they even have a small flock of chickens and a few geese.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Mrs. Ross tries to be friendly, but Mother just sits and broods."
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",So does Hannah.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",The guards became quite used to that because many other women were doing the same thing.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Early this morning Jamie and I went down to the small stream that we were camped beside and Laddie surprised a raccoon washing something in the water.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I think I will sleep well tonight.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Jamie is busy throwing stones into the water for Laddie to chase after and I’ve had to pull him out twice.

ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Mother was working in her garden this morning and Father was busy clearing as usual.

ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Grannie will be able to spin tow thread out of the flax.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","They are very welcome, as we only have a very few earthenware plates and bowls."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",This year we will have to make do with the rations we have received from the soldiers and what Father can shoot.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","And then … I don’t want to remember, but the pictures are all in my mind and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to forget them."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Grannie was holding Margaret, but the baby was all wrapped up with only a small bit of her face showing, and she wasn’t making a sound."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",I saved the biggest piece I could for Hannah.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It looked like the worst storm in the world had hit here.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","Mother has knitted socks for Father and Angus, but I am knitting these for Duncan."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",(How do you “regulate the blood”?
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They are calling for us to get back on the boat.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Hannah has an Uncle Allan who is also with Sir John Johnson’s Royal Yorkers, which is why her family is going to Sorel too."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","One of the men in the settlement here, Joss Walker, has a turnkey and some experience as a tooth puller."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It’s been so long since I’ve talked with anyone else my age!
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",My eyes will not stay open.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Mother has given me a blanket to pin around my shoulders and wear when I have to go outside.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","With Laddie bouncing around us and barking his big head off too, of course."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Now father is hitching old Blue up to the wagon and leading it away.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Jamie has an enormous bump on his head and Grannie has made a vinegar-and-smartweed poultice to put on it.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",She is out early every morning replenishing her supply of roots and herbs.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Jamie and I found a blueberry patch today in a rocky clearing near the river’s edge.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",But she doesn’t even seem to know or care how pretty she is.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I won’t let myself believe that anything could have happened to him.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",We traded for some of our precious cloth and more flour.
ch14,"November 1st, 1784",His tail is twitching and Mittens is staring at it.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","I looked up across the river to the other side and there, looming out of the fog, I saw a hill — a mountain, really, but such a mountain as I have never seen before."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They set our cornfield on fire!
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Father barely stops for a break at noon time.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I grabbed him and hauled him outside.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",Father has allowed me to stay home from school so that I may sit with her and feed her.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Then they brought him back and threw him down in the dust.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","It is going to be a long, difficult winter."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Good news from Angus!
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","I will either have to learn to stitch more quickly or delay my marriage for a long, long time."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We were both drenched.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I do love cuddling her when she’s not screaming or stinking.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",We have been given two.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Perhaps their wives could teach me how to do the intricate beading that decorates their clothing.
ch14,"November 1st, 1784",It is snowing.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Dear Canada: With Nothing But Our Courage
June 1784
The boatmen sing constantly as we go along."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",I must help with supper.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",It was a very satisfying feeling to batter out that fire.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",My boots are wearing out and by the time I get to school in the morning my feet are wet and frozen.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The path we’re on dwindles down to almost nothing in places and it is very hard to make it out.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I miss Margaret so terribly.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","I close my eyes and I can hear the water rushing along the stream bed, gurgling and rippling its way over stones and around bends."
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","I put cloths soaked in cool water on her forehead, but she is so feverish and hot that they dry up within minutes."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I must stop writing now and practise my stitching.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",We will have to make do with what we wear on our backs.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I couldn’t help myself.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I cannot see them but I can feel them.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",They soaked the quilts in water and threw them on the burning roof and on the rooves of the houses next to it.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",She carries her own load and tries to lighten mine when I am carrying the baby.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",Mother is watching Jamie and I have a great swatch of time all to myself before I must go and help with the noon meal.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Jed Turner used to be just as friendly as a next-door neighbour could be.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Jamie gave him a few.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",I even helped build the privy.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",She loves to quilt but it has been so long since she has had a chance to do so.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Still a cuddly cat though when she feels like it.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","As we made our way along the road today, we realized that we were passing through country that had been fought over."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“You’ve been such a help, Mary,” she said to me."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I think Mother is having trouble feeding her.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Neither Jamie nor I had any intention of obeying her, of course."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","“I see a wedding in the spring,” I heard Mrs. Livingstone say, and Mother and Aunt Norah smiled at each other."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Smashing!
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","They have to fell the trees, then cut them into proper lengths and hew them into shape."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Thank goodness the weather remains fine and cool.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","“It’s a new country with new ways, Mother,” he said, and would not let up on her, but even so I was amazed that he managed to convince her."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","I’m tucked up cosily in my quilt now, though, with the stub of a candle to give me light."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",One thing is a little difficult to bear.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Angus and Molly never took their eyes off each other.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The fare for the boat is so exorbitant, we will need the extra money to meet it,” Father answered."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","The fire is burning brightly, Laddie is stretched out snoring before it, and Mittens is curled up right beside him, purring."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I’m not at all sure of the spelling, but that is what it sounds like."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I could not understand the half of it, but the Indian’s voice sounded very bitter and angry."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We have bundled everything up and are waiting for Father to fetch us.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I can say anything I want here and not be chided.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It’s all ashy now and smudged.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",It was so good!
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Father wants to trade with the Indians for more corn.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We’ll be on a boat when we reach Lake Champlain, if Father can get one."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",First I will start with what Uncle Allan and Uncle Andrew brought us.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","Father was quite cross with him, which wasn’t like Father at all."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Mother didn’t wait for Grannie — she laid into him with a switch herself.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Father says the fire was probably caused by sparks from the wooden chimney.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Father told me that Loyalist families have been promised free land there in recompense for their loyalty to the King, but I can’t imagine he ever thought we’d be the ones leaving our homes."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I suspect this is what they were talking about last night after we had all gone to bed.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","It didn’t help, either, that there was a brisk wind blowing."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Hannah and I amuse ourselves by exploring along the river shore, but Father and the others are fretting about the delay."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",After dinner Father presented me with a doll that he had whittled himself.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The weather is fine and that seemed to lift my spirits a little.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",It made me feel sad all over again.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","The men all brought axes and saws, the women brought food."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",There is no one to talk to.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I almost cannot bear to write this.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",She is all black with white paws so I have named her Mittens.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Hannah has been over and we have been helping Grannie.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","Neither Angus nor Duncan would dare drink under my Mother’s watchful eye, but several of the other men laid into it quite enthusiastically."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",A hardy little thing to have survived all it has survived.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Tonight she saw how blistered my feet were from walking and rubbed them with goose grease.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","I am back to school now, but Hannah is not."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I’ve never slept outside at night.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",My head was hurting so much I felt dizzy.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",Some of them were charged with taking the smaller children out to play.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They were our neighbours.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Father tied a cage, with as many of our chickens as could fit into it, to the back of the wagon, but we had to leave the geese."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","I think Mrs. Livingstone knew, however, as she gave Mother a very warm hug."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","We have been promised by Governor Haldimand that we will be supplied with bolts of cloth and blankets from the King’s stores, but I fear that those who arrived before us have received most of them."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I just hang on tightly and let the water spray over my face.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We can’t kill any of the chickens, of course."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Then she just ran at him and hugged him until it’s a wonder his ribs didn’t crack.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","I’ve been to bees before, of course, but never was one so special."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Tonight John brought his son with him to visit our camp.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Mother has wrapped her good china platter in the feather tick.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","“A papist custom,” she snorted when the invitation came."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","Meanwhile, in the kitchen, Mother and Grannie and Hannah and I, and all the other women and girls, were busy cooking and baking."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","Not being able to 
do
 anything for all those long months was worse than having too much to do, I think."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","It has finished blooming of course, but is now covered with glossy green leaves and looks very satisfied with itself."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","I was standing right beside her, waiting to receive a bowl of porridge from her to put on the table, and I could see her fingers suddenly clench the bowl."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Jamie is snoring beside me.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I think we are all chafing at being so shut in during this horrible weather.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",I supposed he was returning the favour and acting as first-foot for the Ross family.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",I prayed extra hard for Hannah today.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Having a road to join us makes such a difference.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",And what do you think — we have moved Grannie’s lilac bush outside and there are fat green buds on it!
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I am helping Mother hoe it but the ground is so hard and so packed with roots that we are having a very hard time of it.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",To the Province of Québec.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","The Indians showed Father how to make that, too."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",What a terrible day!
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","She is the tiniest thing I have ever seen, but very brave."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Perhaps it is just as well that I haven’t learned 
too
 much French!"
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",“We went to war.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Father told me he has heard a lot about this Chief Brant.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","As before, there are four families in the boat — including the Rosses, thanks be — and all our belongings."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Father had decreed that I should take Jamie, even though he is so young, and George and Hugh went as well."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Now I am going to write the story of how Angus and Duncan escaped.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","By this time Jamie had figured out what was going on and he was kneeling under the tarpaulin and looking out, his eyes as big as I’ve ever seen them."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I felt embarrassed and dreadful all at the same time.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Our wealth is not intact.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","It looks calm and flat today, but I can sense a powerful current flowing underneath the surface."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","When we got to Angus’s shanty, Duncan was there waiting for us."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The wagon is heavy-laden and Blue is not used to such continuous work.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",“Sooner or later you have to lie down.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","We will have a grist mill on the river here next spring, it seems, but this will have to do until then."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Thanks be to goodness the dog managed to make it to the shore by itself not too much farther down.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","At the moment he is running around in circles like a mad thing, chasing his tail."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","I was despairing because I was running out, but when I screwed up the courage to ask him for some to take home, and told him what it was for, he gave me a whole bottle!"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The tea did taste horrid but it made my head feel much better.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",How will we ever cook our food?
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Later
Father came in with four squirrels and Mother is making a stew for supper."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","We’re all pretty hardy, as a matter of fact."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Of course they don’t call them slaves any more, just servants."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",A cloud of smoke was billowing up from the north end of the settlement.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","– more ammunition for Father’s musket, which he sorely needs
– two scythes and a sickle to help us reap our harvest next year
– a frow for splitting shingles so that Father may make us a proper roof
Oh, and a host of other boring but necessary things."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Grannie is beside herself.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Perhaps he is not as mean as I thought he was.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","Still snowing, I suppose I should say, as it never seems to stop."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","Everyone does what they can, even Jamie and the other small children."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",How can he bear it?
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The devastation was dreadful!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Try as I might, I cannot make sense of all this."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","She pounces on his tail when he is sleeping and he jumps up, ready to do battle, then gets all soft and loony when he sees it’s just the kitten."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I could not help but wonder how deep it was.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",We will have pigeon pies all winter.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“Good evening,” the Indian replied."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Grannie puts cream in the churn in the morning and by evening the jolting of the wagon has turned it into butter.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We have finished up all the bread we brought with us, and Father didn’t want to take the time to light a fire so we are just going to have stale johnnycake."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","Boxes of provisions as well, and seed for planting, although Father, who is standing beside me, is worried that we will not be settled in time to plant our crops this year."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","Mother made us a feast tonight, cooked in our own fireplace."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I felt fresh and new and alive again.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","There are so many people here at Sorel that compared to this place, Chimney Point was quiet and peaceful!"
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",I’ve never seen her so spry!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Everyone is sick except for Father.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Father has made a bundle of tools.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Father has just walked by and put his hand on my shoulder.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Hannah came by after our supper.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","We pushed the table aside and made room for the frame, then set benches all along the sides."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",Mother looked stricken when she heard the news.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Mother is so happy!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I’ll see if I can get her to feed.”

ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",We are up at sunrise and fall into our beds when the sun goes down.

ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They are very dour and keep to themselves.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Our song.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",That is hard to imagine — Mr. Ross was so jovial and friendly yesterday.

ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Father was furious.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Again that grimace … and then yet another swig of the whiskey.

ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","It took a whole day of bargaining and bartering and Father is exhausted, but we are all well pleased."

ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Jamie kept hunched up in a corner, all white-faced and quiet."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",You should have heard the cursing and the yelling.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","Just exactly at midnight, by the old clock that Father managed to bring with us, there was a knock on the door."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I hope it was not a bad omen.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",But then I have to open my eyes.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","How big will the waves be when we get out on the wide part of the lake, I wonder?"
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","“It’s a lovely cabin you’re building for us, Robert.”
Mother smiles a lot lately and is so much more like her old self."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Mittens has retreated to a safe distance, thoroughly disgusted."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",But I don’t even care because we are going to have a quilting bee.
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",It is snowing again today and just as cold as ever.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","We always killed a pig and used “everything but the squeal,” as Grannie would say."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",When Mother saw him lying there she just started to cry and shake and couldn’t do a thing.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","He worried that it was a little dried up and shrivelled, but I assured him that it was perfect."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","We will have to be assured of plentiful supplies and help.”
“Governor Haldimand is promising that very thing,” Father answered."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The Indian, whose English name is John, is one of a party of Mohawks who are also travelling to Canada, and he has good cause to be angry and bitter."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We are to follow this new river now up to Lake Champlain.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","Now, as long as we get those supplies …
The roof is going on today!"
ch14,"November 1st, 1784",As I write this I can look around to see Grannie spinning away and Mother sewing and humming under her breath.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Angus and Duncan were both in the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Yorkers and they were captured together by a rebel patrol when they were out on a scouting foray.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","I am hiding out of her sight in order to write this, and Angus disappeared after the noon meal."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","Duncan must have realized what I was going to ask though, and he answered it anyway."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I am in disgrace.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",She seems happier when she is carried and does not cry as much.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Almost frightening.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Amazing that such a loud purr can come forth from such a small animal!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","It is a very wide river — bigger than any stream I have ever seen, and the water just seems to rush along in all sorts of ripples and swirls and currents."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",Angus says if they see it again they are going to shoot it and we will have bear meat for the whole winter.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","We built a huge fire and feasted to our hearts’ content on boiled fish, turnips and potatoes, and we are all warm and dry."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I wonder if they will talk about what happened?
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",When things settle down.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",I wonder if Duncan will go to Johnstown as well?
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Even his voice has shrunk.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Even though they will be settling near us, I am sore afraid it will be quite some time before I see her again."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",How was I supposed to know there was a lump of ice in it?
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",It seems Duncan has taken note of my habit of scribbling and thought I might be able to use them.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","There’s no saying that to Grannie, though."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",She just shook my hand off.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“Here’s a pass for you, Tory,” they shouted, tossing a piece of paper after him."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","At first he seemed at a loss as to what to make of them, then he decided he liked them."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","She was stretched out on her bed, sobbing."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“I declare, Robert,” she used to say, “I don’t know where you pick these things up.”
But he never paid her any mind and just kept on singing whatever he wanted to."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Baby Margaret died!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I don’t dare speak to her, either."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","“He will need it.”
“Mary, Jamie, outside with you then,” Mother ordered."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Father was good at keeping order, but he was never mean."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I wonder why he’s bringing soldiers with him.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",It is very hard to wait.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","Mother has her feather tick that we carried all the way here, but the rest of us will have to do with blankets thrown over balsam fir and pine boughs, until we can harvest straw next summer or get corn husks next fall."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I joined her.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",I am too cold and wet to write much.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",She is still weak and Aunt Norah insists on her resting up until she gets her strength back.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Oh, how I hope this means Mother is starting to accept our new life."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Hannah took me over to their campsite to show the oxen to me and introduce me to her family.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Then he said a few words in his own language that sounded like a question.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It was our field!
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Then, just as I was leaving, Mother thrust something into my hand."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",They have made arrangements to hire a wagon and will go west to Montréal.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","We have long tables set up as desks, with benches to sit on."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",It was up to Father to pick him up and bring him into the warmth of our cabin.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",When I came down from the loft this morning I knew at once something dreadful had happened.
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","It feels splendid, even though it is still freezing, and the ice on the river is beginning to show soft spots."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Father would not allow Jamie to use one, much to his disgust, but set him to collecting the branches as we chopped, and piling them up."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It was much quieter when they were sick.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“I wish John had stayed with us a little longer,” I said to Father this morning, but he just smiled and gave me a hug."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",With no wagon.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","I have not said so, though, as I do not wish to be teased."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Angus is here, and so is Duncan!"
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",They also brought spruce and showed us how to make tea out of it.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","It is not much bigger than the coop Father built for our chickens and it only has a hole in the roof for the smoke to escape, instead of a proper chimney, but Angus is very proud of it."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",A letter from Angus!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It is so good to have a friend again!
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Grannie has made a poultice for her chest but it doesn’t seem to be helping any.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Angus said he was hoping so much that he would meet up with us here, but could hardly believe that it would happen."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Later
We’re camped for the night now."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Hannah saw, of course, because we always walk together, but I didn’t mind that."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",It was nice to see him again.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Now that we are both feeling better, Hannah and I are beginning to enjoy the sailing."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The lake stretched ahead for as far as I could see and the mountains rose up high on both sides of us, right down to the shore on the western side."
ch14,"November 1st, 1784",I think he is chasing rabbits in his sleep.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I remember when Jamie was a baby Mother sang to him all the time.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","The slopes were covered with trees, scarred here and there with steep, bare rocks."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",As it was he howled and raised a terrible commotion until we finally made it to the other side and onto dry land.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","There will be two small windows, Father says, one on either side of the door."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Still, he prayed for the safety of those of us about to embark on our “perilous journey.” I was glad of that."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I am feeling so twitchy.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Mother is smiling again and even Grannie is in a good mood.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","I was really, truly happy!"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Finally, he stood up and left."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We could not see the river from where we were, but the noise of it now was so great that we could hardly hear each other speak."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I could barely make out what he was saying.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I wonder if I will ever be happy here?
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The mountains now loom off to the east of us a good distance away.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Father is worried that we might get lost, striking out on our own."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Mother and Father have the feather tick that we brought with us, but Grannie and Jamie and I make do with blankets that the soldiers have given us, spread over balsam fir boughs."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","They mostly speak French, so we cannot talk to them, but they are kind."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Mother is making pies at a great rate and is salting down the rest.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","At least, I watched the sky lighten."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","The 
bateau
 in which we are travelling is like the one we sailed Lake Champlain in, but flat-bottomed to make it easier to drag through the rapids."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Duncan came by with a brace of ducks this afternoon.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Looking at her in the firelight, I suddenly realized that she must have been very pretty when she was young."
ch14,"November 1st, 1784","There was just a knock at the door and Angus and Duncan have come in, shaking snow off their caps and jackets."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Father was right.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",It is not something that I really want to think about.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",Finally!
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Lisa and Obediah came over to where I am sitting now by our fire, in dry clothes with a blanket wrapped around me, drinking catnip tea that Grannie brewed for me."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Thank goodness Laddie did not see it.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I remember Mother dyed it that colour with goldenrod blossoms.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","Dear Canada: With Nothing But Our Courage
October 1784
We were most surprised to see a man on horseback ride up the path to our house today."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","Without stopping to think, I grabbed up a handful of snow and threw it back at him as hard as I could."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",I wonder if it is more than just missing his family.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","They talked for a long time, in English and in the Indian’s own language."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",She is quite small and the water was over her head.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I did not know what to do.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I wish Mother could be as brave.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Grannie has her own blanket but Jamie and I have to share.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“Besides,” he’d said, “if I don’t fight for the British I’ll have to fight for the rebels, and that I will never do.”
It was after that that our friends and neighbours began to shun us, but we never imagined things would come to this."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Mother rushed forward to support him and snatched up the paper.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It feels lonely without John.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",That means they will have to travel during the winter — I cannot imagine how hard that will be.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",It is very beautiful.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","And then …
This is the part I cannot write."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I just wrote down the date and then realized it is exactly one year since I started this journal.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",His face got all still and he looked away from me.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",She definitely does not like the boat.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Father, Angus and Duncan will begin building the cabin tomorrow."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They just dragged him!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They are such a nice family and it is so wonderful to have a friend.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","I sat with her all afternoon and tried to get her to drink the teas Aunt Norah had made for her, but she could not get them down."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","It is much, and we are very fortunate to have been able to get here safely."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","I did not tell anyone at school, but I did tell Hannah."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",There was a tremendous amount of blood for such a small cut and he thought he was dying.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The lake itself does not look so big from here, but Father says he has heard that it gets much wider farther north."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",They spear the fish with long spears.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Grannie has brought her bedraggled lilac bush into the house for the winter and it sits in a corner, well wrapped up in burlap."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",It must be horrible to be their slaves.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",They obviously wanted to trade and this time we were able to do so.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I suppose at five years old none of this means anything to him.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Jamie and I walk most of the time so that old Blue doesn’t have such a heavy load to pull, but we do get tired."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","When Uncle Allan said he had supplies for us, he didn’t tell the half of it."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I would be very happy to be home churning butter right now and I wouldn’t complain a bit.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",It was so beautiful I could hardly breathe.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",My own brother.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","“Besides, Andrew, the Regiment will be staying together."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The dog followed along, although he still won’t come near us."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I mourn the loss of blueberry pies.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",We have been provided with a few slates and we take turns using them.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",All of us are families of men in Sir John Johnson’s Regiment and we will settle together.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Now we are getting ready for our own celebration.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","I could see that Father was chafing at the inactivity when there is so much to do, but in this Grannie will have her way."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",It was Angus!
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Angus says they learned how to do this over the winter when they were working at Cataraqui with the army.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","I used to hate that and get really cross when he did it, but I didn’t today."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Grannie and I picked herbs today.
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",The weather has turned sunny and all the snow is dripping and melting.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Later still
The meal was delicious."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",But Laddie did not appear and Jamie would not go without him.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","It’s hard to remember that Father and I used to talk 
every
 night after our evening supper."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",He didn’t mention Duncan.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I soon found out.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","We are to be taken in boats up the St. Lawrence, past Montréal, to a town called Lachine."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","They will all come here in a week or so, then Father and the boys will go to the Rosses’ place, and then on to the other neighbours who join in after that."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Everything is all abustle because Christmas is coming.
ch14,"November 1st, 1784","The wind is howling outside, but all is safe and peaceful in this little house."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It is Sunday today.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",I will have to stop writing.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","I do not know why that works, but it does."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","And it seems we might have a dog, too."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Now I’ll describe how it is done.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","Mother got very quiet when she read his words about Margaret, but she is so happy at the thought of seeing Angus again."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","“We can do it, Fiona,” he said."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","“Yes,” she said."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Now I am knitting a pair of socks.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The leaves on the hill on the other side are still brilliant, but it is getting quite cold."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","Hannah is almost back to her old self again, but she is very thin and tires easily."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",The Rosses are camped right next to us and we shared our supper tonight.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","That won’t be for a while, though, I don’t think."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Was that not enough?
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Chimney Point
We have made it to Chimney Point!"
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","It is settled now, though."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","There will be no cellar or foundation for this cabin, but Angus and Duncan dug a small excavation which will be reached through a trap door in the cabin floor, by means of a ladder, and we will use that as a root cellar for the time being."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",The whole business was messy but the hams hanging up in the fireplace chimney to smoke made it all worthwhile.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",It was hard work.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Very confusing!
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",“Do you think they would be given back to us?
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I can understand that — it is exactly how I feel.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",Hannah might die!
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I do not even feel like the same girl.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",Mother leaves the room whenever Father talks of these plans.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Grannie is much mollified but it hasn’t made us feel any better.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It was not much more than a whisper.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",We leave tomorrow.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I think Father is very disappointed.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He just nodded.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","I’m not quite certain what “intact” means, but I imagine it means he’s still got his money."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",One of the boats almost tipped today.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",It’s not like the bread we used to bake at home.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Mr. Ross let me pet them.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I think we will need all the prayers we can get.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",I could not have borne it if I had burned her as well.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Shortly after that he called Jamie back and we returned to Angus’s cabin.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He gave a huge leap and the next thing I knew we were out the gate and down the road, Blue trotting faster than he’s ever trotted before and Jamie and me rattling around on top of the wagon like two broken teacups on their saucers."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","I was digging away at the garden, fighting those dratted roots and saying words under my breath that I wouldn’t want Grannie to hear, when Laddie began to bark furiously."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","It is called Machiche, and we will winter there."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","When we were finished eating, Mr. Stanton brought out a fiddle and the dancing began."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We should reach the southern tip of the lake tomorrow, and John told Father that Chimney Point was just another day or two’s journey up the eastern shore of the lake."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The trees are all red and yellow and orange and just glorious.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","It has been coming around Angus’s shanty for the last few nights, so finally he and Duncan laid in wait for it and when it turned up last night they shot it."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I was surprised to see how expert she was.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Father says he will make them high enough so that there will be a loft for Jamie and me to sleep in.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",We will have bear roast for dinner today and plenty of meat for the winter.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They took to each other right away and soon were playing some sort of game with sticks and stones.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","I will probably have the smell of wet dog in my nose for the rest of my life, too."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I might just sneak a piece of johnnycake to him after everyone has gone to bed.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",What did we see in the light of the dying fire but three men untying Bess and old Blue!
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Isn’t that strange?
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","We will have to depend on Government supplies for the winter, Father says."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He looked sick.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","Hannah is not, however, although her mother has the same medicines."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I’m curled up by the fire now.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",I was happy again.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It would have been like when we used to go on outings to visit neighbours or to picnic by the river.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","He works as willingly as Angus, but he does not seem to be as happy."
ch14,"November 1st, 1784",I have not been able to stop thinking about what he told me.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Children are running wild and it is noisy beyond belief.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","Mother makes Laddie sleep outside, though, and Jamie is not happy about that."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Even Mother and Grannie get out when we come to hills.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I wish I could talk with them.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",He is going to Cataraqui where there is already a school built.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",We have just finished going through them and are camped for our noon meal.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Now, in desperation, John and his family are going to join their chief, Joseph Brant, at a place called Fort Niagara."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",What a journey this is turning out to be!
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","Fortunately I will have several years before 
that
 happens, but all girls should have at least two or three quilts done before then."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","“We cannot depend entirely on the Government for all our supplies.”
Then Jamie gave us all a scare by deciding that he, too, should be able to chop wood."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I expect we will be eating a lot of that.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Of course, I would have sacrificed it if it were needed, but I’m mightily relieved that it wasn’t."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Even Grannie is keeping out of her way.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Angus managed to get a lot right next to ours, and Duncan was finally able to swap for a lot nearby as well."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",She does not like it one bit and Laddie keeps sniffing at it and looking up at me with a decidedly anxious look.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",She is peeping at me from behind Lisa’s skirts right now as I am writing this.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",He is living with them until he gets his own cabin built.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“You worry too much, little Mary,” he said."
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","Our preacher, Mr. Murchison, came over to sit with Hannah and Aunt Norah today."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",We have been eating that since we arrived here.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",How quickly we are leaving behind all we’ve ever known and loved!
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Mother boiled up some dried blueberries and we soaked it in the water from them and dyed it the prettiest shade of pale blue.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",The leaves haven’t drooped a bit.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",We are too tired even to talk.

 happy."

ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Our long journey is finally over.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I can see some boats out on the water and they look very small and are tossing around in a most alarming way.

ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Even though the sailors make up a good stew for us each night, or else fry up fish that they have caught in the lake, I have not been able to force the slightest morsel down."

ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",We go next week!
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","When his sniffing grew a bit too rough, she just arched her back, ruffled up all her fur, spat at him like a little fury, and scratched his nose."

November 1784
The skies are grey and gloomy and I can smell snow in the air again."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","I just shut my eyes and bury my nose in the deep purple blossoms and inhale great wafts of their smell, and for a moment or two I can almost believe I am home and all of this has just been one long bad dream."

ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I knew it.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","Just look at how much they’ve done for us.”
There’s also a huge vat of ashes to be made into lye for soap and potash and to use in the privy."

ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Father is digging a hole next to the house and that will have to do.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","I think the thought has crossed Father’s mind, too, as he looked very pensive when Uncle Allan mentioned it."

ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Father has helped me pick out a spot for my apple seeds and I planted them carefully.

ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I reached out and took hold of his hand.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We each made a bundle of our clothes.

ch1,"October 6th, 1783",She didn’t wave.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Angus is just Angus — my brother — I’ve never thought of what he 
looks
 like."

ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He spoke slowly and haltingly, but the Indian seemed to understand him."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",John and Father talked together for hours last night after the rest of us went to bed.

ch3,"December 1st, 1783","I cried all the way to school, but managed to stop before I got there so that no one would see."

ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Father is very excited about it all.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I’m not, though."

ch1,"October 6th, 1783",A girl who looks to be just about my age has come up to where we are camped and is standing staring at me.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","My father and my two older brothers on one side, and I on the other."

ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","We have used some of the brush and smaller trees to make a fence around the garden to keep out deer and other wild animals, but there is nothing to be done about the stumps that are left, so we are just scratching around them."

ch2,"November 1st, 1783","We have been given a bake kettle, a tea kettle, an iron skillet and an iron pot for cooking."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",No one noticed that the bonfire was spreading.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",That will be a welcome change from salt pork.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",We are here to stay.

ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Their house is a little bigger than our cabin but still, it was packed with all of us."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","“You have to build your strength up,” she said."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Jamie and I have made a sort of nest in the wagon, padded with the feather bed."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I can’t remember the last time I saw her smile.

We made the crossing, but I’m still shaking with fear."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","The rest of us in the family will also get 50 acres each, including Jamie and me."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Grannie steeped the dried leaves of it and gave it to Mother whenever she had indigestion, though, and it always seemed to help, so I suppose it could not be all bad."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","We are having 
another
 snowstorm!"
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Laddie had to sniff her over as soon as he saw her, of course, and you would think she would have been afraid of such a huge monster — she isn’t even as big as his head — but no such thing."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","I hear more shrieking, and it is decidedly not gleeful …
Later
I suppose it was to be expected."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Grannie took charge and made certain everyone was made welcome and thanked for coming, then she made us a cold supper after they had all left."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",That was thoughtful of him.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","It will not be much of a meal, I’m afraid."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","How can I tell 
him
 not to?"
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I will have this sound in my ears for the rest of my life!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Mother is boiling up a pot of turnips and potatoes to go with the partridges, but she is not behaving like my dear mother at all."

ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The night is clear and the stars are so bright the darkness here below doesn’t seem quite so dangerous.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Uncle Allan said that they have built a church and Mr. Murchison preaches there on Sundays.

ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Mother let out a cry and Grannie put her arms around her.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Grannie is trying to look disapproving, but not very successfully."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Hannah is such a good friend.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","“It’s just for the winter, Mother,” Angus told her."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",He certainly seemed sillier than usual when it came time to wash up.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",All this strangeness is definitely upsetting baby Margaret.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We were following alongside the river for most of the day, although the land along the river’s edge was gradually rising and the river was falling farther and farther below us."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",I am writing in French!)
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",It would be so good to be able to go — we would feel so much less alone if we could meet with our neighbours once in a while.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",Hannah and her family are right beside us this time.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",At one point I thought the small boat we were packed into would founder.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","I crept out of our tent, carrying a sleepy Mittens, and watched the sun rise."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They’re just as much slaves as they ever were.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","I was almost too shy to look him in the face, remembering what had happened the other day, and he seemed ill at ease as well."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","This may sound strange, but that’s actually a comfort, even if she does scold me ten times a day for things I really can’t help."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I think it has gone bad.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","I used to hate helping Mother boil the fat down for lard and soap, though."

ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I did not know what was going to happen and I feared for Father.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","No strings of dried apples hanging over the hearth, either."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Grannie will not leave her bit of lilac bush, though."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They actually knocked her down and not one of them stopped to help her up.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Grannie, however, has not stopped upbraiding me since it happened."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","In fact, Hannah and I were actually leaning over the edge to catch even more spray until Grannie put a stop to it."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It is nice to see him smile again.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",The Irish lit candles and placed them in the windows to welcome Mary and Joseph.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","It will be a long journey for them, Father says, and they might not reach the Fort until early next year."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He still smells, though."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",There are so many trees around here where we’re camped that the dark comes early.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Then, suddenly, the dog burst out of a nearby clump of bushes, his tail between his legs and his eyes wild with fright."

ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I would never have believed he could be so gentle.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Mother has gone to settle Margaret, and Jamie and Grannie are asleep too."

ch5,"February 1st, 1784","“There’s no one there but Indians and a few French trappers,” Uncle Andrew said when he was visiting last evening."

ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Grannie has not stopped scolding Jamie since we set up camp.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","One of them walks just like
Later
I am so excited I can hardly write."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It is not any kind of adventure that I would ever have wished.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","She wouldn’t even let me out to go into the bush to relieve myself until I convinced her that it was 
absolutely
 necessary!"
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",He was very impressed that I am keeping a journal.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I am in a daze.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Some plants will not be ready for picking until September or October, Grannie says, but there are many that we can harvest now."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I don’t suppose any boy will ever be sweet on me.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",The river is almost open now and we are to leave next month.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","When Grannie gets mad at you, you’d better skedaddle out of there."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Grannie makes a tea out of it that she gives to us if all else fails.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",For that we are called names and thrown out of our homes!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Her mother puts her hands over her ears in desperation, but I enjoy Hannah’s talk."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They are a handful.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","We also had boiled fish that Father and the Indians had caught, and roasts from another deer that Uncle Andrew Ross had shot."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Later still
The stew was delicious."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",This morning I felt quite ashamed of myself when Father explained it all.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",He hates that!
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",I am being called.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I think he fears for his nose.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Spearmint tea and mullein tea for colds.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",He sits and stares at her with such a moony expression.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We hurry through settlements and towns as quickly as possible.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Mother feeds her, then she sleeps, then I carry her for a while."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I don’t think anyone but me noticed Duncan slip off into the shadows.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",We have also been supplied with a few pieces of furniture: a table and two benches.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Grannie’s little bit of lilac bush waves its leaves above us.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","At first, when we stopped here for the night, she just sat in the wagon holding Margaret and staring back the way we had come and didn’t make a move to get out."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I think I will go talk to her.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Mother passed Margaret back to us, to give her a rest, she said, and the baby slept between us for most of the afternoon."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Mrs. Livingstone calls the baby her “first little born Canadian.” That made me stop and think.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",She went more quiet than I’ve ever seen her when she realized she couldn’t take her spinning wheel.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","I saw Danny heading toward me, no doubt intending to ask me to partner him, but thanks be Duncan beat him to it and I made certain to avoid Danny from then on."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",We will use stumps for tables and benches.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He saw that I was writing in my journal and gave me a smile.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",The Rosses left soon after that but we stayed on talking for ages.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",I cannot bear to think of it!
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","We knew there were Indian villages near here, but so far we have seen no sign of the Indians themselves."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I do not know what to do.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I am keeping Mittens in the tent with me for fear of wild animals.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",My own best friend.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The waves calmed considerably and the boat moved along in a much more relaxing manner.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Somewhere along the shore of Lake Champlain
I have not been able to write in my journal for two days because I have been so sick."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","I do believe I saw just the ghost of a smile twitch at the corners of Father’s mouth when he turned away, though."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I have never seen anything more beautiful in my life, but the power of it was fearful."
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","The officers of the Regiment maintain that it would be impossible, and I am very afraid that they are right."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",My goodness!
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",We are beginning to prepare for the logging bee.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","He had hidden it away for me all this time, the scamp."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","Angus was over helping, although there is still much to be done on his own lot."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",For my marriage!
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Johnstown!
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",All of a sudden there was a great outcry from one of the boatmen and we all rushed to see the fire racing through the leaves on the ground and heading for the forest.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We’ll make much better time sailing on the lake than walking around it, he says."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",As I sit here I am warmed by the fire and can see the boatmen cooking our dinner.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",All the women are getting together to try and find scraps to give to Mrs. Livingstone so that she can make a new quilt.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","Anyway, he told us that Uncle Andrew and Aunt Norah have built a cabin much like ours, and Hannah is fine."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",I am so excited!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",She does not sing to Margaret.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The road is very rough — not much more than a track in some places.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I like to look at those four boulders and imagine a nice snug cabin built on top of them.
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",I must admit to a queer little feeling of excitement inside me.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",What were they thinking?
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","It sounds just as gleeful, though."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Even the sheds and the barns were destroyed.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Before I knew what was happening, the Indian had settled himself down by the fire and Father had offered him some leftover tea."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I hope our roof doesn’t catch on fire!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Jamie and I clambered up in the back and perched ourselves on top of all the things we had packed in there.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","The birds are nesting, the sun is warm warm warm!"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Now we are all huddled under tarpaulins and trying to keep dry.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Father turned as white as a haunt and without a word he cracked the whip down on Blue’s back.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",Her breath is raspy and I can see the effort it costs her to breathe.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",His duty is to give directions for the safe management of the boats and keep them together whilst we are on the river.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","Even though Mother and Father are working so hard, they are much happier than they were last winter."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",He stopped.
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",The sap is running!
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Grannie has rapped his knuckles more than once and she is getting exasperated.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They even threw a bench through our glass window.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","She pretended not to even notice him, but her eyes got very bright and sparkly when she saw him, even though she denied it when I teased her about it."
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",And we reaped such rewards!
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","I thought for one horrible moment that he was going to ask to see it, but thanks be he didn’t."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","It has been raining constantly, with the result that we have had no fire and have had to make do with cold johnnycake and salt pork to eat."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",You would never know what is growing wild out there if you didn’t have someone like Grannie to show you.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I saw Father grasp the rungs of the chair so hard his knuckles turned white.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Mother looks quite frantic — I wish there were something I could do.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Laddie doesn’t seem to see the reason for it and is not cooperating very well and the other children are laughing at him.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","Still, Jamie had a good time."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","That makes it easier for us, I suppose, but somehow doesn’t seem quite right to me."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I just couldn’t look.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",The Livingstones were all piled into one wagon and Mother and Mrs. Livingstone were so pleased to see each other again.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He was more ill than any of us but was delighted to get a piece of my well-toasted fish skin.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",No one can see me here.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",I will have wool to knit myself a good warm pair of mittens this winter.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I could not stand it.

ch2,"November 1st, 1783",The salt pork tastes very odd.

ch1,"October 6th, 1783",There is a minister here and he held church services this morning.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",The words seemed to catch in his throat and he stopped for a moment.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",He even made Jamie and me a small lunch of freshly caught fried fish from the stream and bread that he had baked himself.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","The Scots don’t celebrate the way the others do, but it is exciting nonetheless."

ch7,"April 6th, 1784",Hannah whispered to me that Molly kept talking about Angus and hoping that she will see him again when we all meet up in the spring.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",That used to be my daily chore.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",And that wasn’t the worst of it.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",This is what happened at the bee.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",They are very clever.

ch1,"October 6th, 1783",And here we had to part with John.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","When I think of our lovely house back in Albany … But no, I won’t think of it."
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","The remedies must be working, though, as I am getting better."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It seems much longer.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",This is made by mixing salt and sugar into mashed potatoes and water.

ch12,"September 6th, 1784",They tossed sacks onto the ground and took out ears of fresh corn.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",On foot.

ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Without our animals?
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","His shanty is on the same stream that runs through Angus’s and our properties, but I think it is more prettily situated."

ch2,"November 1st, 1783","The weather is very cold and I truly thought I would never stop shivering, but the tea is warming me up and I finally have."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","“It will be a blessing to be in my own home again,” Mrs. Livingstone said."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Father gave him his own knife to work with and it is Jamie’s dearest possession.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It does seem to make me feel better to write in this journal.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I am tired, after our long journeying, but it comforts me to write."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","When we stopped to make our way back and eat the fried pork and johnnycake Grannie had ready for us, my shoulders and arms were aching."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I didn’t scream, but I must admit I had my eyes squinched tight shut."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",John says the name of that river is the Mettawee.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","We will feast tonight, and the weather is cold enough that we will be able to keep the rest of the animal hanging up outside the door, well out of the reach of Laddie, and any wild animals that might venture near."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I must admit I just stood there staring, frozen, until Mother grabbed me by the hand and pulled me back to my shelter."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",We slather them with Grannie’s ointments.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",“You’ll see.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I wrap myself up in the cosy woolen shawl that Grannie knitted for me, and when Jamie and I go to bed at night I almost appreciate the warmth of that smelly dog."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","It is nothing but a wilderness!”
Father tried to reassure her, but it did not seem to help."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The person who bought their loom paid little more than a pittance for it.

ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","“No wood floor this year, I’m afraid, Fiona,” my Father said, “but next year I’ll put one in for you first thing.”
Mother just shook her head."

ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Luckily we had a good supply of salt pork on hand as Father had butchered our hog last month.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",I am frightened for her.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",So she hit me with a snowball and got snow all down the back of my neck.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Mother is distraught and that makes baby Margaret fussy.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","My eyes want to close so much too, I am so tired, but I just had to write this down."

ch9,"June 1st, 1784","It is just so grand to have such a warm, furry little thing to cuddle."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",They have cut it up and Mother is busy salting the meat down.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",His voice was not Father’s at all.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","Angus came round early this morning and said he wanted us to go see the shanty he has built, so Mother packed a picnic lunch and off we went."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",The boys have all deserted and those of us who are left are far too agog to settle down to lessons.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","“Things will surely have settled down by then.”
Father just looked at her and didn’t answer."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",He is bellowing out “The Golden Vanity” at the top of his voice even as I write this.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",There is nobody else around — just me and the birds who are singing their hearts out.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","John says we are all right so far, but that the way gets more difficult, farther ahead."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Mother was very upset when she heard that Angus would not be coming with us.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",She looked as if she had been struck.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",They are surveying the land.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",We have cleared enough space for our cabin and a small garden.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Now Mother is calling me to go to bed.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",The privy out back is horrible.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",It was a feast!
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","A few dropped in spite of myself, but I do not think they did the quilt any harm."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He figures that at the pace we’re going we should be there in not much more than another week.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Dear Canada: With Nothing But Our Courage
December 1783
I have really been too sad to write in this journal this past week."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","(It was Father, I found out later, making a tiny coffin.)"
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",The soldiers have built a whole town full of little log houses for us all.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They have the loveliest brown eyes.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","“I wouldn’t have lain down,” I told Angus when I heard that."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He told me that this part of the country was originally settled by the French and then, during the war the British had with the French over who would own this country, the British invaded here and all the settlers were forced to flee."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",And that Mr. Mitchell had chosen just that moment to come out of the schoolhouse?
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",He came to bring us news of his family and to see how we were.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We manage to avoid most of the sharp corners and edges of the furniture piled in there and it is quite comfortable.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We’ll be back.”
But back to what?"
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",So much has happened.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Today we had a snowball fight at school, girls against the boys."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Grannie once tried to get me to chew the roots of it to “quieten my nerves,” but I managed to talk her out of it by promising to be exceptionally quiet without it."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I have the answer to my question and I am feeling terrible about it.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",To go with it we had johnnycake and boiled turnips.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",They had to scrape the bristles off the dead pig so Father could sell them to the general store for a bit of extra money.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Dear Canada: With Nothing But Our Courage
July 1784
We are all registering for land but there is much skullduggery afoot."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","She is curled up on my lap right now, purring away."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Oh dear.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I can hear all sorts of noises and scurrying sounds, too."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","The going is very hard even though there are no hills to speak of, thank goodness."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Father seemed to get on very well with them.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",That dog smells ripe enough without skunk smell added to it.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","There is a small little spot in my heart that feels 
almost
 warm again."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","What will it be like, I wonder?"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Not even to myself.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","There were no roads, just tracks through the bush, and nothing really to indicate the boundary lines, but finally after much searching we managed to find the markers placed by the surveyors."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",And Mother says she will teach me to knit socks.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",“We are to help build grist mills and sawmills to be ready for all the settlers next spring.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",(I heard Father say that to Mother one evening.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","John said he thought he could find a better place to make the crossing, so he and Father have gone off to scout for one."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","There was nothing to be done for it however, but to use them."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Their baby is toddling all over the place now and Mother couldn’t stop laughing at her.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Angus and Duncan shot their bear!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I looked back once, then when the current took hold of us I could not do anything but hang on for dear life."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","He threw me out of the house and declared that as far as he was concerned, I was no longer a son of his.”
“But that’s terrible!” I could not even begin to disguise how shocked I was."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Jamie was most upset and certain that she had hurt Laddie.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",She is curled up beside me as I write and she has finally fallen asleep.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","At first I was disappointed that there were no windows in our little house, but now I am glad."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It would be so nice to be five years old and not worried all the time.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","For a moment I thought he was going to strap 
me
, but he didn’t — girls never get the strap."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Hannah tells me she will not speak of the loss of her loom.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Their village, which was big enough to be a regular town, was burned, and their homes destroyed during the war."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Father abstained.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",The one about the sea.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","Sweetened with maple syrup, it is quite refreshing and they gave us to understand that it is healthy to drink it in the winter when we don’t have fresh vegetables and berries."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Jamie gave me an apple that Mrs. Leake had given him last week.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",The women chatted the whole time — talk of babies and recipes and such.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",Mother does not want me nursing Hannah.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","“Just go away.”
So I did."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","“You girls, come and join us,” Mrs. Livingstone said then and made room for us."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",We have no butter now but it did not even matter.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I know what it’s like to have Grannie mad at you, and I don’t think Mother needs that on top of everything else that has happened."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Water streamed in and Mother screamed.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","I am sitting here with my leg wrapped up in cloths and Grannie’s black alder ointment smeared all over it, but it still hurts so much that I cannot stop weeping."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","Meanwhile, we all live in tents issued to us by the army."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","“We don’t know yet, little Mary,” he said."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",“The men have worked hard and they need their reward.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","She has just made a hot fomentation for Father, though, as his tooth is still paining him."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Father answered him right away in the same language — he had learned a little of it back in Albany from the Indians who traded there, I know."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We have left the Hudson River now.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I think we all feel the same.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","He is as thin as Angus and looks just as worn out, but there is something else about him."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",He brought with him a jug of whiskey and set it on the table.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","“Don’t be so disapproving, Fiona,” I heard Grannie say."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Left everything I’ve ever known in my life.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Especially for the legs of horses.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",They did find one poor unfortunate snake sunning on a rock but Laddie barked at it (that’s when I heard him) and scared it away.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He just stood up and held out his hand to the Indian as calmly as if he had been our parson back home.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",I was allowed to quilt with the women.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",That would make it even colder.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Or one of my brothers?
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",I cannot remember the last time I tasted an egg.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Father loved to sing too, but he favours more rollicking songs and sea chanties."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Her breathing is so raspy!
ch14,"November 1st, 1784",This writing in a journal is a habit I find I cannot break.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","“My fingers will have forgotten how,” she said at first, apologizing, but she needn’t have."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It looks dangerous.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I wonder if they will miss us at the service?
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I do not see how it can survive, but Grannie can be very stubborn when she wants."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",but no hams.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Then Mother helped him up and with his arm around her shoulders she supported him into their room.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","“Throw him your berries.”
Jamie did so, but he had sense enough to hang onto his pail."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","And all around us there are other homes, other cabins and gardens and fields coming into being."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",I’ll try to write later on.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Potatoes and turnips, but no root cellar to put them in."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",No one in the room spoke a word.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",She is at her spinning wheel all day long.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","“I am just fortunate that I found a place here with your family.”
He stood up, drew me to my feet, and we carried the buckets of water home."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Her name is Hannah and she and her family are going to Canada, too."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","“Robert does not take whiskey,” she said."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",But we still have Bess and Blue.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I would not ask another personal question.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","That’s what we sang when we went door to door, and my how we sang!"
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","I ran out to see what was the matter, and there was Jamie, lying on the ground, white and senseless, with Laddie nosing him worriedly."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",“Our very clothes are scraps — what could we possibly give them?” she asked.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","“We cannot 
afford
 accidents.” I have seldom seen him so angry."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Mrs. Ross is helping as much as she can, but nothing will make that baby stop wailing."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","They are all leaving us here, though."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",At night we come onshore and make our camp.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",and hoes and axes and other tools.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","Jamie, of course, is constantly underfoot and has his fingers in everything if we don’t watch him."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","“Go away, Mary,” she said, her voice all muffled and shaking."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He is a great leader, Father says."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Then Margaret started grizzling and she went to soothe her, but I didn’t mind."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","The cabin is finished, and Father built a privy out back as well."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","He says they are going to show him how to make moccasins, too, out of the deerskins we have — after he tans them — so we will have shoes for our feet this winter."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I saw Hannah and told her what had happened.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I do not know how to write of this.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I am sitting in front of our tent.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","Laddie, by the way, was very unhappy at having to travel in a boat again."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","We left the encampment at Johnstown very early in the morning, well loaded down with our tents and supplies."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","Also, Grannie wasn’t anywhere around."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",There are dogs running loose all over the place.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Grannie is chipper and cheery.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",We will bury Margaret tomorrow in the small Presbyterian graveyard.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",How to begin?
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",He assures us that we are nearly at Sorel.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Grannie saw how bad I was feeling today.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Now to tell of all that happened.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",She is a weaver and will not be able to take her loom.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Mr. Mitchell went with them.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","Later
It is night now and I am tucked into my bed, with a tallow wick to give me light."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","“We will be going home next spring,” she said."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The dog actually looks quite respectable and has a fine coat indeed.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",It is so peaceful.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Anyway, it seems that Duncan’s farm was not too far away and one day who should appear to visit them but Duncan’s mother."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","He had just helped me out to the front stoop to sit in the sun and keep an eye on Jamie, and for once he didn’t even tease me about anything — I think he actually feels quite sorry for me — when suddenly we heard the noise of horse’s hooves."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Danny is just as dimwitted as ever.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Father and John came back and led us farther downstream where they said we could cross.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I did sneak a tiny bit of johnnycake to him last night.
ch14,"November 1st, 1784","It is going to be another hard winter, I think."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",She has been just miserable on the boat.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","He always used to say that I looked just like a little brown mouse and I hated that, too, but today it made me feel warm and happy."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Oh, what if he doesn’t treat them well?"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Even Lizzie hissed the word “traitor” at me, but we are 
not
 traitors."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","“I owe you an explanation, Mary,” he said to me, his voice very low."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Mother and Father have curtained off a section of it with an old blanket — that’s where they and baby Margaret will sleep.
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",We’ve been working for days collecting the buckets of sap and lugging them over to the boiling areas where the big iron kettles are hanging over the fires.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Her face was all twisted up and she was crying.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We just had johnnycake and cheese that Father had purchased at Chimney Point, but it tasted wonderful."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",We have so few clothes and no means yet of making more.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Father and Mother share a small one, Jamie, Grannie and I share the larger."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Mother showed me how.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Grannie is worried too and it is making her very cross.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I suppose we’re Canadians too.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I wouldn’t watch.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","If we’re lucky and if she has her new loom by then, it will be Aunt Norah."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","They paraded Father through town that way, shouting vile oaths that I cannot repeat even to this journal."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Then Jamie sassed Grannie and she switched him and now 
he’s
 gone all grumpy."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“There’s a waterfall up ahead of us,” Father said."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I expect I’ll have to carry that, too, somehow."
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",Grannie firmly believes that it would bring very bad luck upon a house if the first-foot were a redhead.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","He just barely escaped with his life, and Mrs. Livingstone had to follow him and bring the children with her all by herself!"
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Also a meagre supply of salt pork (I am 
so
 tired of salt pork!"
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Who needs boots now?
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","It makes writing quite difficult, but I certainly don’t care."

ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","Then Jamie declared he had to go, too, and Mother said we couldn’t go alone, and Father said he had better keep a watch out, so it was a regular parade into the bushes to the latrine."

ch1,"October 6th, 1783","When that Indian appeared last night, I leaped up, totally without care for my journal, and it nearly fell into the fire."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It makes me too sad.

ch12,"September 6th, 1784","It is an even better one than the one she had in Albany, as she can sit down at it and it has a foot treadle for turning the wheel and a removable wooden bobbin."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","The quilting bee is the week after next, and she will be able to go so we practised our stitches."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Mittens is attacking a leaf with great ferocity.
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",I am terribly afraid that she is neater than I and her stitches are tinier.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",And that was the last I ever saw of them.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Mr. Walker pulled and pulled and my poor father hung onto the chair and tried so hard not to howl with pain.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Then he squeezed my hand tightly.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I don’t suppose I shall ever have a home again.

ch2,"November 1st, 1783",There are times when I truly feel I cannot put one foot in front of the other and I am so grateful for her help.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","Canada is my home now.”
Mother fell silent but her mouth did not tighten as it usually does when we talk about never returning home again."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Now — if we only had good thick cream to pour over them!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I have only a tarpaulin spread out over branches above me and I feel like I’m right out in the middle of the woods with no protection around me at all.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I must admit that I still have a hollow kind of feeling inside of me when I think of what might lie ahead of us.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",The Indians came by today with a freshly killed wild turkey.

ch4,"January 1st, 1784",Aunt Norah is beside herself with worry.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Janet says she and her mother and her older sister, Betsy, have started piecing together the patchwork for a quilt top already and they are very grateful for all the material."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Father 
must
 have been grateful — as well as a goodly amount of our supplies, he gave John the last of his precious tobacco."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Then Mother sent me to the stream to fetch water and to my surprise Duncan offered to help me carry it back.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","Best of all, Mother confided in me just two minutes ago that we will have our own little “born Canadian” come next spring."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“Whistling girls and cackling hens,” she says, “always come to some bad ends.”
Who would ever have thought I would miss Angus so?"

ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Not like his old cheerful self at all.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","“It is important to let them know right away that disorderly conduct will not be tolerated.”
I don’t think he really approved, though."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",As we got close we saw flames leaping up out of the roof of the cabin.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Suddenly I heard Jamie cry out and I opened my eyes to see the dog being swept down the river away from us.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",A lot of the other prisoners were getting sick and they were afraid they’d become sick too.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We can only take what we can carry ourselves.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He is sick, as we all are, but it’s more than that."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Father shot a deer today!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","They burned their houses as they went and all that was left were the chimneys, standing up tall and lone."

ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I have no idea at all where Québec is, only that it’s a long way away from Albany."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Mother and Father had the most awful argument — and they never argue!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He tells 
me
 not to worry."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",But back to the dog.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“You could be dead.”
That doesn’t cheer me up one bit."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Get in before you let all the warmth out.”

ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",The walls are starting to go up!
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",We have only one tent for our whole family.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",I will finish this tonight in bed.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Mrs. Ross looks tiny beside him, but she is so bossy with him that I had to hide my face so they wouldn’t see me laughing."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","All of us except for Grannie, who stayed to tend the fire and cook a very welcome meal for us."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",School goes on.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","Besides, what do you think we would have to return to?”
Jamie and I were shocked into silence."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","I will make a list of the ones I know:
Spikenard for coughs and colds."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Angus turned up at our doorstep early this morning and we all rushed off to see it.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",The river still has some ice in it and the trip so far has been frightening.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Mother says she will make me a buckskin skirt next.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I was overcome with dread.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Raspberries are my very favourite and they seem to be Laddie’s favourite as well.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Jamie is asleep with a big smile on his face.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",It is enormous!
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","“I have shot beings far more dangerous, Mary,” he answered and his face got suddenly all flat and grim."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","When we had finished quilting, we tidied everything up and all headed for a sort of community hall that has been built here for our gatherings, carrying the pots and dishes of food we had brought with us."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",I remember we used that once on old Blue.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",I had oatcakes and bannock and plum cakes enough to share with the whole family.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I knew there was something very wrong going on with him.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Father and the boys have started cutting pine trees for the logs for the walls.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I must go.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Then I went back and crawled in beside Jamie, thinking that maybe I could give the dog something else in the morning."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Mother has been walking around the house like a ghost.
ch14,"November 1st, 1784",But how different it is from this time last year.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","After a while you don’t even notice the rats crawling over you — you’re just grateful if they don’t bite you.”
“Oh, Angus!” Mother cried when she heard that."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Father lifted up the jug and took a mighty swig of it.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","They left the fish anyway, which I think was very kind of them."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Mother is using thread made from the fibres of basswood.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",It is almost two years since I have seen him!
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",She’s a grand singer and soon the three of us were just roaring the song out.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","He was even more frightened than I, and crept off to huddle on his bed tick."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",There is no room to get up or move around at all.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Even for me that’s hard work.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",There would probably have been presents.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I suppose I should be grateful that I do not have to do it any more.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Father says that news has come that the English have now completely evacuated New York City and the last of the Loyalists have left America.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It is refreshing.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Father had already harnessed old Blue to the wagon and we fled to it.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",“Do you think your family will come up here and settle?” I asked him.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Jamie is very proud because Father has given him the job of whittling a stick of wood into shavings every evening, to use to coax the fire back alight in the morning."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",She made Father pause long enough at midday to brew me up one of her simples.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Even the chickens in their cage were making a racket.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Duncan is very quiet.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","It was rude.”
“Why in the world should you not?” he answered."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",I have had a wonderful surprise — Angus brought me a kitten!
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I must practise my stitches this winter and maybe I’ll be allowed to do some of the quilting.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",If it weren’t for the current I would think we were on a lake.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",One boatman had to fend off huge chunks of ice with a pole while the other rowed with all his might.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",Some of the men who will be sailing the boats in which we will go upriver got drinking and wild last night.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",When you keep the starter in a warm place it gets all bubbly.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",Which we had to do immediately after setting off from Lachine.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",Aunt Norah is hoping that once we are settled he will be able to make a new loom for her.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","I am almost too weary at night to write in this journal, but I will make myself add a bit to it before I sleep."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It’s strange — Mother has always taken care of me but now I almost feel as if I must take care of her.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The oxen are called Buck and Bright.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","When they finally left, Father turned to us."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Because we were going downriver we sped along at an unbelievable pace.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","It bore her initials, M.M."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","In any case, when a snowball hit me on the head and splattered freezing wet snow all down the back of my neck, I was furious."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","I was quite sooty, but well pleased with myself."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Oh, I saw a skunk, too."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","I’ll welcome your help.”
Well, I’m certain my face almost split in two I was smiling so hugely, but I sat down beside Hannah without a word and took up a needle."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","“Mother thinks of you almost as another son — I 
know
 that!”
“I would like to think so,” he answered, but he didn’t sound convinced."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Unfortunately for Father, they already have a schoolmaster here in Machiche."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","We got to the stream and filled two buckets, but instead of turning back immediately, Duncan sat down on a log and motioned for me to sit beside him."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Black alder mixed with lard, resin and beeswax for scalds and burns."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Duncan showed me all around with such pride.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","We heard no more sounds of pursuit, but Laddie kept turning to growl and we ran as fast as our feet would take us until we were safely back."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Mother’s hands started trembling.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",I can hardly believe it.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",What will happen now?
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Grannie does not let us do anything on Sunday!
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",She has not come out of her room all day.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The leaves are beginning to change colour.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The chickens are squawking as if they know something terrible is going to happen to them, and Bess is bawling."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Father just walked by and told me that it 
is
 considered a lake here and is called Lac St. Pierre."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Mother has told me that I mustn’t keep it lit for too long.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Those two boys are little devils.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Out of our own home!
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",All scabby and red.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","Hannah is no better, but neither is she any worse."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",She says she will not move without it.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Mother is pacing back and forth with baby Margaret, but Grannie is just sitting like a stone."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",I cannot see trying to carry a snake along with us!
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","There is a Presbyterian preacher here, his name is Mr. Murchison."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",Just then the baby began to cry and Janet moved to pick her up.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","“They believed firmly in the Patriots’ cause, but I believed just as firmly in the Loyalists’ stand.”
“What happened?” The question asked itself."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Then I heard hammering behind the house.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",It’s too gummy and causes the chimney to soot up.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I just cannot believe it.”
I know exactly how she feels."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I saw something very unusual this morning.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Then Uncle Andrew and Aunt Norah came right over.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Mother didn’t say another word, but tightened up her mouth in that stubborn way that looks just like Grannie’s when she’s set on something, grabbed baby Margaret from out of my arms and went back into the tent."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",People kept coming by all day long.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","She’s lovely and tall, too, not short like me."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We stop on the shore each night, but only long enough to make a fire and eat — that is where we are as I write this — and then it is back into the boat again."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","We knew those men would be hungry when they finished their work and my, were they ever!"
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I do hope that when we settle we will be somewhere not too far away from each other.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",He is huddled up in bed beside me right now and is making little distressed-sounding snuffling noises in his sleep.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Father is slowly learning their language and has taught me a few words.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",And I have a dreadful head cold and a very sore throat.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Then he coughed and sputtered and made a terrible face.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“But I can’t be quiet,” she said."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",No wonder Molly is often cross and bossy.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",Janet and Betsy told me all about it while we quilted.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Mittens has decided she wants to play with Laddie.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","I can use a drop spindle of course, all girls can, but Grannie is going to teach me to use the spinning wheel as well."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","First we lost William, now Margaret."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I wonder if her uncle knows Angus?
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Anyway, John has asked if he and his band could travel with us for a while."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",My old ones have holes in them and my fingers get frozen and it’s so cold in the schoolroom that they never warm up.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Mrs. Livingstone gave us the most wonderful Christmas dinner.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","She
 would never act the way Lizzie Crane did."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I can write no more tonight, but I will tomorrow."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He will not be parted from that dog.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",Hannah and I just stood there.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","Uncle Allan not only managed to procure a horse, but he tells us he has a wagon as well."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He only misses Angus and keeps asking after him.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","I looked over at Duncan and was about to ask him a question about his mother, but the look on his face stopped me."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","So I joined in, very softly at first, but gradually we both got louder and louder until we were sitting there with the wind blowing all around us and the smell of the water in our noses and singing at the tops of our voices."
ch14,"November 1st, 1784",I think she is about to pounce.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He tripped once and the whole wagon tilted.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",It is a mercy that we do not have much.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",And the mosquitoes were terrible.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","The cabin is beginning to take shape, however."

ch5,"February 1st, 1784",“And all the land is heavily forested.
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",Governor Haldimand announced yesterday that he had received word from England promising us all the supplies and assistance we will need.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I stared and stared at our house and garden, trying to fix every single detail in my mind until we turned the bend in the road, and then it was gone."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I am used to being the top girl for my age.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","We could make them out of the hide of the deer that Father shot, once he has it tanned."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Laddie is happy too.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Instead she just stared at Father.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",We have talked ourselves silly.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","I had a lovely half hour before the mosquitoes woke up and I just sat there, listening to the birds awaken and breathing in great gulps of the fresh, pine-smelling air, with Mittens frolicking around me."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Our preacher, Mr. Howard, would never condone it, I’m sure of that."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",This morning I was first up.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I think she is beginning to be a bit tired because of the baby.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The scowl she gave me could have curdled milk.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He looks smaller, somehow."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",His name is Mr. Mitchell.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I think Mr. Mitchell is mean.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",“But it is not to be.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Thank goodness we had Angus and Duncan with us as they could carry an enormous amount.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",Our own little house at last.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Grannie is glaring at me even as I sit by the fire and write this.
ch14,"November 1st, 1784",I fairly flew back up the ladder.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Mother barely had time to cook porridge tonight over the fire that Father built, before it began to rain."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","It is so hard, travelling all day every day."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","Was it not enough, Fiona,” he roared, “that I was publicly humiliated?"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Jamie has named him Laddie and keeps calling and calling him, but the dog doesn’t trust us enough to get within kicking range."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",The boys were shooed out of the house and Mr. Livingstone disappeared to do some work outside.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The men seemed quite terrified of him, although one of them landed a good kick on the poor animal’s side."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","I was looking forward to that so much, but all of the fun went out of it when baby Margaret died."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I’m not the cause of it now, though, and at least that’s a mercy."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",There is an older sister named Molly and two younger brothers named George and Hugh.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","We live in trees so much of the time that I am used to it being dark and shadowy, but I suddenly realized that the sun had left the clearing where we were and was far down in the sky."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",She gurgles and burbles and is beginning to look all around her.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",And I’m very glad of it.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",It is just one room.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Mr. Mitchell has set Hannah and me to teaching the youngest ones their letters.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",This war has turned everyone insane.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","We are due no less as a reward for our loyalty and to recompense us for our losses, the Governor said, but Father and the other men want to see proof that he can fulfill his promises, so the Governor has written to England for that assurance."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",For once she was smiling and her face looked all soft.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","Somewhere on the St. Lawrence River
This is the first chance I have had to write in my journal since we left."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",He looks … haunted.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Hannah said when the man who bought Buck and Bright drove them off she is sure she saw tears in her father’s eyes.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",All other work has stopped and Father and Angus and Duncan are bending their efforts toward making a road.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",We only found them because I heard Laddie barking.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Everything is in a heap.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",His mind is all closed off.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They smelled of it and they were all red-faced and shouting.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",Very embarrassing.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I didn’t wave either.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",It must be horrible to be anybody’s slave!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I am going to be sick again.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He’s quite big and has long grey fur, but it’s all matted and dirty."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",I think she was really still hoping that something would happen to prevent this.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","It looks very dead to me, but Grannie does not give up easily."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","I thought writing in my journal would help, but it isn’t helping a bit."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Not like Lizzie Crane who was always on about how fair her skin was, and how she didn’t freckle the way I do."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Food is being distributed, but no clothing yet."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I’ve been friends with her since we were born!
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","I am much too old for dolls, but I did not tell him that."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","We have been given generous rations from the government supplies, and with Angus and Duncan to help we will be able to carry everything, although they might have to make more than one trip."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They point their muskets right at us and act as if they think we are criminals or spies!
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","In fact, he suddenly leapt to his feet and strode a few paces away, then stayed there with his back to us."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Father and Mother used to sing and laugh together all the time.

ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Somehow or other their fire went out last night.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","“We will not be 
settling
 here.”
“Fiona,” Father began."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Then George and Hugh started playing war with Jamie and Jamie — who is younger and smaller than they are — fell off his seat trying to get away from them, and Laddie started jumping all over George and Hugh, trying to protect Jamie, and the helmsman yelled at them all to sit still and not rock the boat, and soon all three were crying."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","But now we have a problem, Father says."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",They must go to rejoin their regiment at a place farther upriver called Fort Cataraqui.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","It makes it a little less worrisome to know that we will have a good supply of fish and game laid in for the winter, even if we won’t have too many crops."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Mother is calling me.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","We managed to bring home a whole bucket full, though."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Grannie had already gone to her tent and so had Jamie.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",He is very worried about it.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Hannah and I have no secrets from each other.

ch2,"November 1st, 1783",She went into her room and I have not seen her since.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Mrs. Livingstone had fattened one of the geese up especially and roasted it for the Christmas dinner — I can’t begin to describe how delicious it tasted.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Lisa was almost crying and she just kept saying, “Thank you, oh thank you so much for saving my baby,” over and over."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",It has survived!
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",She is getting quite independent and has turned into a very good mouser.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","The cabin looks so safe and cosy, nestled in under the trees."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",And the prettiest.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",I do not know how we will stand it.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","(New York State, I should say, now that it is a part of the new United States of America.)"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I do not know when they sleep.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","I almost wish that dog 
could
 make it up the ladder."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",His battalion is being disbanded and he will be here with us before the end of the month.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","For dessert we had Lumpy Dick served on Mother’s china platter, made with raspberries that Jamie and I picked."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",But I’m getting ahead of myself.
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","It was hard work, especially forging through the snowdrifts, but I’m very sturdy."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",“I was just about your age when I helped my parents build theirs.” Then she laid to and soon had a small tree down and in pieces.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","(She sounds very much like Grannie, I think.)"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",No more pipe in the evening for him.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",At least they have better axes to work with.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Thank goodness the ground is not too dry yet and the flames were soon under control.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",That tooth is bothering him more and more and he has been very out of sorts.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Sorel, on the St. Lawrence River
We arrived at Sorel late this afternoon."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Catnip for stomachache or sore throat.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We’ve left our home behind us.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Mother just stood there.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Very few books — only those that Mr. Mitchell brought with him.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It was worse.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Father’s face lightened as if the worries of the world had been lifted from his shoulders at that news.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",We had proper church services today and it did raise our spirits.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Father is just as stubborn in his own way as she is in hers.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I ran after her.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","Some had wagons, some just came on foot."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Mr. Ross met up with him this morning and now the Ross family is celebrating.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Uncle Allan Ross brought them some good big double-headed axes.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",We all stood with our hearts in our mouths until the men got it under control again.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Then it began to snow and that helped as well.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",She used to say I was far too boisterous for her liking and I should have been born a boy.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Father reached over to give Angus a hug and Mother started fussing around him again and brought him a cup of tea.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Not too bad if it doesn’t rain, and the weather is not too cold yet."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",So I guess they didn’t forget after all.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",What a day!
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Perhaps by next summer we will be friendly enough to visit them there.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Better than I am, anyway."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","The 
bateau
 is manned by five sailors, as was the Lake Champlain one, but these men are French-Canadians."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","I like it, actually, it is very cosy; but Jamie is cross because he cannot teach Laddie to climb the ladder."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I cut it neatly into five pieces after supper and we all shared.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","“Don’t watch, Jamie,” I said."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",The logging bee was today.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",That was terrifying enough.
ch14,"November 1st, 1784",Laddie is fast asleep but his paws are jerking and he is making little whining noises.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I think also that Father was out of sorts because he has a toothache.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",George is a year older than Jamie and Hugh a year older than that.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I’m beginning to worry again.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","The only way to get into it is by a ladder, through a hole cut in the ceiling."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We are stopped now for our noon meal.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",Luckily Uncle Allan Ross does not have red hair.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",She was just beginning to be a person.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",That would have been too sad.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I don’t know what Hannah’s mother would do without Molly, as her bossiness comes in very handy for controlling those two little boys."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Even people we have not met yet.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I would give anything for one of Grannie’s hot teas right now and I wouldn’t even complain about how bitter it was, but I don’t dare ask her."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","There was just enough wind to let the sailors use the sails, but not enough to make big waves."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Oh, what a tale that is!"
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Mother showed me how to turn the heel and I have already made one.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","It made me realize how lucky we were that there were no battles too near where we lived, although one day I did hear gunfire and cannons booming."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",There are waves lapping on the shore.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","We’re certainly not American any more, and we’re not really Scottish any more either."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I suppose those were songs that she didn’t approve of.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Smashing!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We are camped close to the riverside and as I write this my ears are full of the sound of falling water.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I dare not ask him as he just sits on the wagon seat, silent, his face as set and stony as a rock."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","At first I thought he had been unable to find us a boat, but it was not that."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I can hear them shrieking with glee and Laddie is barking his head off.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",There is nothing for us to do.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",It is going to be a busy winter.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Mrs. Livingstone came over to us just then and reached out a hand to touch one of the squares.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",So much has changed.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",Now I can write about the rest of the bee.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The boat was skimming along and the wind just seemed to be blowing right through me.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Grannie just snorted when I cried out, and I suppose it is just my imagination."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","We have survived, we Loyalists."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",The whole camp is in confusion and we are packing up all our belongings for yet one more time.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Jamie burst down the ladder, calling to Laddie."
ch14,"November 1st, 1784","He must be so lonely here, knowing he will never see his family again."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The chickens we’d left in the yard were all scattered and clucking and running around every which way in a frenzy.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",None of us is able to talk.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",There is going to be one mighty problem here.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",“Cowardly Tory!” All because he would not sign their Oath of Allegiance to the new United States of America.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“That is it, then,” he said."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",We have passed quite a few settlements and the people are much more friendly.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He certainly does smell, though."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",In front of his very eyes they tossed torches in through the door and the windows.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",I sopped up every last bit of juice with it.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Father says that some officers have been registering their children as officers so that they may receive a larger grant.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Grannie has always been grumpy, but now she really glowers."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",We will start clearing land for wheat and corn and flax next year.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Not all girls went to school, but Father insisted that I should and I was glad of it."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I certainly would never be friends with Lizzie Crane again.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Jamie whistled and I called, but to no avail for the longest time."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","“And be quick about it.”
Jamie and I scurried up the ladder, but then lay quiet as mice and watched what went on below."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","“You see, Mary …” he said finally, then he stopped and drew a very big breath."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I would like to meet their wives and children.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","Captain Jacob Maurer is in charge and he has been busy all winter, so we have been told, building 
bateaux
 and procuring other boats from wherever he can find them."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","It was a pretty, soft yellow colour."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I just counted up.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",It was very comforting.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","Warmth and comfort for the whole year to come, the first-foot brings."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",The neighbours have been very helpful.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Father taught Jamie and me the French word for thank you.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","They and some of the other men will help us clear more acreage, and girdle the trees too big to chop down, by cutting a strip of bark out all around them, so they will die over the winter."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","When we were torn apart it must near have torn her apart, too.”
“Do you suppose your father and brothers know she helped you escape?”
“I doubt it,” he answered."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“We’ll do just fine.”
I leaned into his arms and let myself sink into the strength and the warm good smell of him."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",And yes!
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I was much impressed.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Smashing!
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Mother did not have raisins or currants for a cake, but she made Lumpy Dick and we had that with maple syrup."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","“Your berries, Jamie!” I shouted."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","“We can go home, that is what we can do,” Mother answered."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Now she grizzles and cries most of the time.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We don’t want filthy Tories in this town!” Although the word they used was not “filthy.” Grannie turned crimson red and
By the light from the campfire
My hands are shaking so that I can hardly write and I’ve made so many blots I can hardly read what I have written."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",It is really quite pleasant after the dirt and confusion of the camp at Lachine.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Hannah says her mother and father have told her the same.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We are making our way through heavy woods and the track is rough and narrow.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Bess lolluped along behind us and bawled every step of the way with indignation.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Hannah was here at the crack of dawn to fetch a shovelful of coals.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",I looked up and there were two Indians!
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","We can never go back.”
Mother stared at him for one long moment, then she let out a cry and ran into their room."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",They brought over johnnycake and bread and oatmeal for porridge.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","“Back where we belong.”
“Where we 
belong?”
 Father burst out."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I recognized the squares that came from baby Margaret’s blanket.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Father looked disapproving, but only said that sometimes strapping is necessary."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",There are other animals about that are not so harmless.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Hannah was sitting on the other side of me and I taught her the words.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",No one chose to speak of the war.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","All in all, it was a feast!"
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","She is much recovered, and we spent a cheerful hour just talking."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",This river is most certainly the biggest I have ever seen.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",It seems that some people are very greedy.
ch14,"November 1st, 1784","We will have to husband our supplies very carefully to get through this winter, but I am certain we will make it."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",She even rested her head on his shoulder.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","I don’t care how much work it is going to be, I just want us to be happy again!"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They have distributed tarpaulins for shelter and we have made ourselves quite comfortable.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",At least no one but me sees my legs.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",It was so much fun.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I am toughening up, I think, and do not get so tired."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","And so lonely without William, Angus and Margaret."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","When I told him Angus was off to fight with the British army he thought that a great lark, and went about for days with a stick over his shoulder, pretending to be a soldier."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I was much more enthusiastic about saying grace tonight!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Father has just returned with very welcome news.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He did find a boat, but it is too small to take our wagon!"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He will die of the shame of this.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Her lilac bush is still alive.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The weather was sunny today and any other time I would have enjoyed it enormously.
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",I had to because the penalty was that I would have to give him a kiss if I couldn’t.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Much nicer than heavy old boots.
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","Oh, what if she is allowed to quilt and I am not?"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",How I have missed him.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",There are two other girls the same age as us.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Some of it splashed onto my leg and burned it badly.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Harder work than I’ve ever done in my life.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He was on it in a split second and wolfed it down.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They pulled Father out of the house and dragged him down the path.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We’d tied Bess onto the back and she was bellowing because we hadn’t milked her.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","After seeing how quickly that fire spread when we were on our way here, even when the ground was still wet, I can certainly agree."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I was given the job of picking them out.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",I think she worries that I might take the fever next.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",The Rosses all came over to make Angus’s acquaintance.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Father encourages us on.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I would not be surprised at all if he is doing a bit of clearing at his place.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Grannie is demanding a spinning wheel but Father says that will have to wait until we are settled permanently.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The track from here on looks very rough and narrow and not well-travelled.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Father is making Mother a new quilting frame and Grannie says it is high time that I started making quilts for my marriage.
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","That dim-witted Danny Snyder made me a wager that I couldn’t, but I did."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Now Father is building a fire and Mother is hanging clothes and blankets up on bushes to dry out.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",It sits halfway up a small hill and the creek runs down behind it over a small waterfall.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","There stood Uncle Allan Ross, holding a loaf of bread and a pail full of burning coals to add to our fire."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",“Get out of here!” she screamed at the men.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",Mr. Mitchell has given up trying to hold classes.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Now Jamie is trying to get Laddie to fetch a stick.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We were just getting ready to leave, after a quick breakfast, when those same men turned up again."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",There is a sandy beach below me and Jamie is in his glory.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",She took one look at the pair of them and told them she was going to get them out of there by hook or by crook.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Father shot two partridges and they are roasting on a spit over the fire.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Grannie has insisted on carrying her lilac bush, even though I offered, and it is looking very bedraggled."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Jamie is besotted with the dog.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I think she’s right, as I pulled George away from the railing of the boat several times and no sooner had we come ashore than I found Hugh trying to braid Laddie’s tail."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",This cabin is so small!
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",My loft is freezing.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","The Livingstones have two young boys as well, and a baby."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“Surely there will be space on that boat for one small dog,” he said."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","At first it didn’t seem to help at all, but gradually they got the fire under control before it spread to the other houses."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",Would you believe it?
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We knew most of them.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Candles are much too precious to waste.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I think he realized for the first time today that we’ve really left our home and we might never see it again.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I’m glad of that because I do love to cuddle her.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",It smelled so bad!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I stopped writing yesterday because just as I was going to say “and put her hands over Jamie’s ears,” I smelled burning."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","It was filthy, Angus said."
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",They are certain she is going.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",No presents here.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I am so mixed up and confused and just plain desperate and my head aches 
so
 badly."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","When she told me this, Hannah began to cry."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I didn’t know how I was going to go back and face Janet.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Mr. Mitchell gave me another bottle of ink yesterday.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I cannot stand it!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Surely the Lord will forgive him, but I don’t think Grannie will."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Then Mother gave herself a kind of shake and pursed her lips.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",The Rickles had an enormous tree and we children all went over on Christmas Eve to watch them light the candles.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","She tried her best to dissuade him, but off he would go."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","There Father hopes we will meet up with Angus, but he doesn’t seem to know what we will do after that."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",My leg is much better and I am able to hobble around now.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Grannie was not trying to soothe or rock her.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","It seems that he and his people have been driven from their lands, too, because they fought on the British side, just the way Angus and the other Loyalists did."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","Here is what he brought:
– more tools for Father, including a good saw (It will be most useful for cutting down the girdled trees next spring, not to mention making a door!)"
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",It seems so unfair that her life should have been so short.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","With Mr. Mitchell off in Cataraqui, I don’t see where they could find anyone else."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Mother is busy organizing the food and supplies that we have been given, but every once in a while she just stops and gazes out at the forest all around us with a despairing look."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Of course we all piled out to see what was going on.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Too much is going on for her to bear, I think."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Some of the settlers have learned from the Indians how to make moccasins — perhaps we will as well.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Most everything we own is drenched.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",We begin to have a little hope.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",His battalion will be disbanded in June at Cataraqui and then he will be free to join us at Johnstown.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Father and Angus are still talking, in fact, but I must go to sleep."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I’ve never seen him so angry.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Whenever I complain out loud about anything, Grannie is quick to jump on me."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He whines from morning until night until sometimes it is all I can do not to slap him.
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","They can barely manage one bucket apiece, and not even that if they’re very full."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I know.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Mother is calling me.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","It would take us weeks to reach Sorel, maybe months, and we would not be able to make it before the winter snows set in.”
“But we can’t just leave everything here!” Mother cried."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","The nights are 
cold
 here."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We knelt side by side, watching Father and the Indian."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Jamie has given up and run to retrieve the stick himself.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Even if we are given land, he has no idea where it would be, or what it would be like."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Mr. Murchison preaches very long sermons.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",It is quite neatly done if I do say so myself.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","She is still very despondent, though, and Grannie is twice as bossy to make up for it."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","No one has ever been able to best me at reading, spelling or ciphering, but Hannah is just as good as I am and, I must admit it even though it galls me to do so, she can out-spell me!"
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","It had been boiling all day and we watched it slowly change from a pale, watery sap to a rich, dark golden colour."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","Well, you’ve never heard such howling."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",The first we have heard from him since the winter.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The British had promised to restore their lands to them after the war’s end, but instead they gave them to the Americans."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","Grannie did not go, but the rest of us did, Laddie too, of course."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Molly seems to take after her mother.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",Tomorrow!
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",We made syrup and sugar as well and there will be enough for all of us.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Hannah and I went together the first day, of course."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Angus gave him a concerned look, then continued with the story, but in a more subdued tone of voice."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Without really thinking about what I was doing, I threw my berry pail and all its contents onto the trail."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Mother and Grannie packed bags and bags of food and provisions.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Grannie sends soups and broths over to her with me every time I visit.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","The times ahead will be just as hard, I am certain of it, but I look around me and see a home and the beginnings of gardens and fields in what was, just a few short months ago, nothing but forest."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Then, one day, Mrs. Morrison didn’t bring their bedding back."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",She is by far the nicest person I have ever known.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","He and Mr. Ross — Uncle Andrew, he has told us to call him, and Mrs. Ross will be Aunt Norah — have cut it all up."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","In fact, it’s very peaceful to walk along the track and listen to the birds singing and twittering in the trees high above us."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",This is where we must part company with John and his band.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We are thankful, though, that there has not been more rain, as otherwise we would be in ruts and mud right up to the wagon’s axles, and the streams we have to cross now and then would be flooding."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Canada must certainly be a long way away.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",What a scare!
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Hannah and I tore over to see what was happening.
ch14,"November 1st, 1784","I would have turned and scampered back up immediately, but he caught me by the arm before I could do so."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","The first time we went through rapids I was quite frightened, certain that all the boats were going to be lost."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I’m very glad we didn’t burn our house when we left.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","It looks tiny and pathetic, but it also looks like it’s there to stay."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“Get out!”
Then she put her arms around Father and he just kind of slumped against her."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",“I left dozens of jars in our wagon.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",Next week.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","We have nothing left in that new 
United States of America
, Fiona."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",They didn’t seem to mind the weevils.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I wonder that Father knows where to go.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I smell snow in the air again.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",She is still Grannie.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",The soldier who was with him.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Poor Father!
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","The other Loyalist men help as well, and Father is always right in there with them."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",We are going for certain.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","“Do you not wish ever to see your own home again?” Mother asked, her voice not much more than a whisper."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",This was their schoolhouse as well as ours.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I am rather relieved about that.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",She thinks Angus very well-favoured.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Mr. Ross is very fat and bluff and hearty and has hair as curly as Hannah’s.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Finally Mother reached out to take her back.
ch14,"November 1st, 1784",Father is making a cradle for the new baby and is carving the headboard into the most intricate and delicate design of roses and leaves all twisted and twining together.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“Things could be worse,” she says."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",There are so many of them!
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Finally!
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Father’s eyes were all red at supper too.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",I do hope she will be able to come back soon.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",He must have shot and killed many men during the war.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",We share it with about four other families.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",This has to be one of the saddest days we’ve had since we had to flee from our home.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They came for Father this morning.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“You look like drowned rats,” Grannie said with a sniff."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Sunday again.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","“But Mother,” I argued, “there’s a fair blizzard blowing out there.” Truth to tell, I was afraid to leave."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",It was such fun to see the people we had come to know at Machiche last winter.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Weevily or not, we will have to use it."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","I’m sitting on the very spot where we will build, right now as I write this, and tomorrow we will start to clear the land."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Grannie is the only one who doesn’t seem to have changed a whit.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He has made friends with several other children already and they are all barefoot and wet and covered with sand.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Grannie did not want to travel today because it is the Lord’s Day, but Father said we had to keep going."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Cold salt pork and johnnycake for supper, but at least we are 
here
."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","It was so hard to say goodbye to Hannah today, but now that we have a road joining our houses, I am certain we will see more of each other."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",He has been swimming in the creek.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",When we stopped for the day he and Father went fishing together and Father brought us back three lovely big shad for dinner.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","We had set up logs and stumps to sit on in the clearing outside the cabin, and a vat of soft soap beside tubs of water which Hannah and I and the other girls had hauled up from the creek."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",We all just munched and munched on it — even the adults.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","“There’s nothing to be done about it,” he answered."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","We had been assured that they were friendly, however, and willing to share their land with us, so we were not frightened when these two appeared."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I think I had better not tease her again.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",And to know that you will never see them again.
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","Hannah was even more disappointed than I, she had been looking forward to going out so much."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",Before we ate we all joined hands around the table and gave thanks to God for all we have.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Mr. Denny is a dour, unfriendly man."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","Dear Canada: With Nothing But Our Courage
September 1784
What a surprise today."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",My stockings have been darned and mended until they are stiff.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We packed the wagon all night with everything that we could fit into it.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Now Mother has forbidden us to go berry picking anywhere except right near the cabin, so I suppose that will mean no more blueberries for us, as they only grow in the cleared, rocky spots down near the river."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","There is no roof or shelter of any kind, so we are praying that it does not rain."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",There was much to be thankful for.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",How could I be a heathen when I go to church services every Sunday?
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",This time I’m going to quilt!
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I’m not that fond of salt pork — and getting less and less fond of it — but I do love smoked ham.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We’re escaping to British Canada, Father says."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","My hands are so calloused and rough that it hurts me to help her wash up after, though."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",This settling of lots was a very complicated affair involving a lot of noise and shouting.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I think he thinks he is her mother now.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Hannah is as sick as I am; so are all her family.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","“But everyone here hates the rebels, and with good cause.”
“Why did —?” I began, but I bit the words back as soon as they were out of my mouth."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",Those dratted stumps do come in handy for some things.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I could hear this roaring noise that was getting closer and closer.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Sometimes wormwood is used instead.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","The two boys were so rambunctious, though, that Aunt Norah turned them out of doors to find wood for kindling."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","By morning they are cold again, though."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Mother and Grannie have not said anything, but they have worried looks on their faces when they tend to her."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Then they set to clearing out more bush and trees.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Now I can write more of what has been happening these past days.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",As if the air had been let out of him.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","“Generous indeed,” she burst out."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I happened to be watching her and was just about to reach out and pull her back when splash — over she went!
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Mr. Mitchell practically dragged me into the schoolroom.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",He is an excellent carpenter and much in demand here.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","“Then up to the loft,” Mother said."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The lake looks to me to be very wide here, but Father says this is still only the narrow part."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“Here, lass, this will take the pain away,” she said and gave my forehead a rub."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","It is so awful I cannot bear it, but I am so full of grief and anger and just plain disbelief that if I do not let it out I will die!"
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","It is still frightening, but so far we have managed without mishap."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","They are big, but very gentle."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","It is a very small piece and she has it in a little pot, wrapped in burlap and soaking wet."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","It tastes 
terrible!"
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","Angus and Duncan are now starting to build shanties of their own on their own properties, but until they are done they will continue to live in their tents."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","That is a nuisance, but I am feeling so light and happy that I can put up with it."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",He was imprisoned with Angus and it was his mother who got them out.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","“Isn’t it getting late, Mary?” Jamie suddenly asked me."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Uncle Allan had all sorts of news to tell us.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Without that paper to show that we are travelling by order of our local Committee of Safety, Father says, we would have been in a lot of trouble."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","When we broke through, what a sight there was to greet us!"
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","This is how it happened:
Our boat was drawing up to the docking place at Fort St. Jean and Tam got so excited she leaned too far over the railing."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We’ve been travelling now for more than a week.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",It was so bitter!
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","The only sad thing is that when we leave for Machiche tomorrow, Angus and Duncan will not be able to go with us."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",The men burned all of the underbrush and small trees and the tops and branches of the larger trees they had cut down and left only the charred trunks of those trees to be disposed of.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",“Of course you don’t.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","The schoolhouse is drafty, too."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",Spring has definitely arrived!
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","“Boys like to test the Master out,” he said."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","It nearly broke my mother’s heart.”
“What did your mother believe?”
“My mother believed in loving her family."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",Mother’s precious china platter sits now on a shelf that Father made for it and she will only use it for special dinners.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",I am just so glad to be in this warm and safe little house with my family all around me and knowing that good neighbours are close.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",That’s why I don’t believe her.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","He stumbled as he put the jug back down, and Mr. Walker reached out a hand to steady him and help him sit down."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",But now we’re back to real with a thump.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",I do hope we get a door before winter sets in!
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","“They would never forgive her.”
“But you are the same family — the same blood!”
“My father disowned me when I told him I had joined the Royal Yorkers."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I noticed that Angus and Molly took a long time to make their farewells.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Her mother had brought it all the way from Scotland with her when she came to America.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Jamie’s excitement at this “great adventure” has worn off and he is getting more and more fretful as well.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",How will we survive without our possessions?
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",He was so surprised!
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I looked up at the sky.
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","Mrs. Livingstone and her daughters have finished piecing together the top, and many of the women in the settlement will get together to help quilt it to the batting and the backing."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","Later on, when we have geese again, we will have feather ticks as well."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I will help her — that has been my job since I was Jamie’s age.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Men were running toward the fire with buckets of water, and women with quilts."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Her “get up and go,” as Grannie calls it."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",It had to be a bear!
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I’ve never known a man to bake bread!
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","“Our house and lands are gone,” he went on."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We had fresh fish that the sailors caught for supper, rolled in flour and fried in lard in a skillet over the fire."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The rain has stopped but the trees are still dripping down on us and everything is so wet it’s hard to write without blotching and smearing the words all over the pages.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Grannie, of course, is never idle."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Mrs. Ross dug into a bundle she had at her feet and pulled out a jar of blackberry jam.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",She was ordering her brothers and Hannah all around and I wouldn’t have been surprised if she had started in on me.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",They are just as bad here as they were back home.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We are following a track through the trees that runs along the river’s edge.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",“There is nothing for it but to leave.” It seemed as if he had to force the words out through his lips — as if his mouth wouldn’t work.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","If he hadn’t, he would have been off to war too, even though he was only fifteen years old."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I have not seen the sun for seven days.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","I feel quite warm and comfortable, actually."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",Just going over to Hannah’s tent today I got the remains of my boots so muddy that Grannie made me take them off before I came into the tent.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",William’s death nearly broke Mother’s heart.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","Father will make a chicken coop for them for the nights, because of the danger of foxes, but during the day they can peck around in the yard."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","In spite of all Grannie’s hot fomentations, his tooth just got worse and worse."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Anyway, to go on …
They watched and chose a time when a whole group of women were leaving together, then they just joined them and walked out with them."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I declare he would have leapt right in after Laddie if I hadn’t.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Father says they cut holes through the ice!
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Grannie said it was fortunate that I could not move from where I was put or I would probably have been jumping all over the poor man.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",But that’s such a story I shall wait and write of it tomorrow.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The wind died down today and the sailors were not happy because they had to row, but I quite liked it."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Last night I heard her ask Father, “How, Robert, are we ever to make our home here?"
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","At least, we thought we were helping."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","“I am so sorry,” I whispered."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The whole world has gone mad!
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Then Mr. Walker inserted the hook of the turnkey and began to pull.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","It’s strange how I go along for several days feeling almost content, and then I wake up one morning feeling homesick and miserable."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",This is what happened.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",As well it should.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","Needless to say, when that was all finished and done with we gave the blanket a good washing!"
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","It is beginning to seem as if we have never done anything else but hew logs, drag them around, and work."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",The stew is bubbling away and beginning to smell very good.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","There were women going in and out every day, in fact."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Everyone wants to sail up to Canada, it seems."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Mother is beside herself.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",What a scare!
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I am going to try to set down our conversation as closely as I can.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Father was sitting beside me today and he was humming under his breath.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He already looks different.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I can’t imagine Father without his evening pipe.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",And we could see them through the doorway.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I’ve seen Indians around our village in Albany, of course, and am quite used to that, but seeing this one just suddenly standing there in the firelight scared the wits out of me."
ch14,"November 1st, 1784",They are going to stay the night.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",The wait grows wearisome.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Granda planted that bush for her when they were married and she said she would not leave without at least a bit of it.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I was most annoyed when she won the spelling bee today.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Luckily it is not very big.
ch14,"November 1st, 1784","Angus was stretched out on a blanket in the corner, Grannie was sound asleep in her bed, and all was quiet behind Mother and Father’s curtain."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Lizzie Crane turned her back on me this morning and would not even give me the time of day.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","“Surely, Robert, you are not 
really
 planning on taking us all upriver into the wilderness?”
“What else can we do?” Father asked her."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","They have stopped laying, though, and are acting very nervous."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Her hands are too old now to soak the stalks of flax and beat them, so I do that for her."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",They are not used to being useless!
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","There will be a sawmill and a grist mill there next spring as well, and the schoolhouse is almost finished."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",Grannie fights against dirt and mud constantly but I do not think she will win.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",Even that did not help as my boots are so full of holes that my feet were just as filthy.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","Her sister Molly was obviously popular with the young men there, but she didn’t seem to favour any one over another."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Then we simmered it in urine to make the colour permanent.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",For once he seems chastened.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","Grannie is furious, Mother says she is deeply disappointed, and Father shook his head."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Tam was not so fortunate, however."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","‘The last of my preserves,” she said."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","My legs just want to 
run!"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",There is so much to say!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The boy is just Jamie’s age.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I didn’t even dare to look at her.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","They even gave Father a little tobacco, so he will be able to have his pipe after dinner again."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He was frightened and wouldn’t let me near him, so I just tossed the johnnycake to him."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It took me a moment or two to remember to breathe again.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",I cannot begin to describe how happy I was to see her again.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Mother did not answer for a long moment and I held my breath.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",The turnips were a little mouldy but I cut the bad parts off and we had a wonderful feast.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",They wanted to trade for flour but of course none of us had any to spare.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",They gave us a tent to stay in and some blankets and food.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Baby Margaret has a tummy full of warm milk and is finally content.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Or, perhaps it’s their mothers and fathers who feel that way."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","But he couldn’t do anything to stop it, could he?"
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Except for the insects.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","That will help with the work, and he says he has been given provisions to bring to us as well!"
ch14,"November 1st, 1784","“Did you knit them?”
“Yes,” I managed to say."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",A bird flew down and perched on a branch near where we had stopped for our midday break and Margaret squealed at it with great delight.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",It is so strange to be there without Hannah.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Mother and Father are being very cold to each other.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I am still feeling sick to my stomach.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Why would we want to live amongst those people again after the way they treated us?
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","And Duncan, too."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",Within minutes her hands were fairly flying over the quilt and I declare her stitches were the tiniest and most regular of them all.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",That would be wonderful.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",It is a military encampment on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","We will probably not hear from them again until spring, but I think that message raised Mother’s spirits a little."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",It was soothing to my soul.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I have no idea how Duncan feels but I don’t dare ask him.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",If a boat ever tipped the man would be thrown into the rushing water and surely dashed to pieces on the rocks.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I truly do not think I have ever seen so many trees.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Tam fell overboard!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",For over seven years — more than half my life — this war has been raging.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",Everyone else is in the same straits.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","It was not quite as wide as the place where we had stopped earlier, but it was still wide enough to be frightening."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Mittens was off about her own business which was just as well as I didn’t want her following us all that distance.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The words all burble up inside me and have to be let out 
somehow!”
Before I realized it, I was talking and laughing with her as if I didn’t have a care in the world."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","(No new dress for me yet, I’m afraid.)"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",George and Hugh were a veritable nuisance on the boat today.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The thought of them unnerves me, I have to admit."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Father may be a grown man, but Grannie still treats him like a little boy every now and then."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Grannie rubs goose grease into them, but it does not help much."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",My hands and arms are thoroughly scratched right up to my elbows.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The river raced by us in a smooth, swift, almost oily sheet, then plunged over the brink to cascade down onto rocks far below."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The dunking in the river went a long way to cleaning Laddie off, and Jamie has soaked him in the lake and combed and brushed him within an inch of his life."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",He is not to go anywhere near the water.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","We are not getting off our boat yet, though."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","It is on a small hillock, right beside the stream."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Especially since the weather is getting colder and colder.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I am still shaking as I write this.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",There is a man called a conductor who is in charge of all the boats.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Why would they 
do
 that?"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We have spent most of a day unpacking the wagon and figuring out how much we can carry ourselves.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",How three small boys can get into so much trouble I do not know.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Father has gone off to hunt.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",My hands are an agony.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",She got all white and gaspy and clutched her apron so hard she tore it.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",One of the other families in the boat is the Denny family.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",My stomach heaved up and I thought I would be sick right then and there.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I suppose I should be excited about going on a boat — Jamie certainly is — but I’m not.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","(If it is one boat it is a 
“bateau.”
 If it’s more than one it’s 
“bateaux.”
 Father taught me that."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",I was stunned.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",What nonsense!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He is as friendly as can be now, and even licked my hand today when I shared a bit of salt pork with him."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Mother hardly talks, and looks so sad and troubled that it just tears at my heart."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Our meal is ready.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",And Ned Bolton — his wife and Mother have known each other all their lives!
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",We dumped our packs onto the ground and Father unpacked the axes.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We are camped now on a long, wide beach."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","And before she could get in another word he said, “There’s no discussing it further, Fiona,” and he turned his back on her!"
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",I wonder if it is the one that chased Jamie and me.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",He is worrying more and more that we will not have time to build a cabin and then bring in any crops at all to help us through the winter that is to come.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They seized Father and dragged him out of the school.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I have been admiring the buckskins the Indians wear and I cannot wait to have such a skirt.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",How very odd.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Mother looked at it and set her lips.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Father has piled all the brush up and we will burn it sometime, but not now."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The only Negroes that are really free are the escaped American slaves who fought with the British armies, Father says."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I’m certain she meant me to.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",It is going to be difficult.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","She has been dosing me with a syrup made of spikenard, which is as sharp and bitter as its name, and I have drunk enough catnip and spearmint tea to sink a ship."
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",Then she spit up the little she did manage to swallow.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I envy the people who have good Indian moccasins to wear.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","That is the fear that is in the back of Father’s mind, I am sure."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Grannie is looking worried.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",But I must.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I suppose someone else is enjoying them now,” she added, then she shrugged."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Every time we use a cupful we must top it up with more flour and potato water.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Oh, yes."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",(Who they make sit at the very back of the boat.)
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Jamie wasn’t giving them to him fast enough, however, so he began nibbling them off the bushes himself."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",A bear!
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","Father swayed in the chair and I thought he would faint, but Grannie was quick to hold the cup of whiskey to his lips and he took a long drink."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","They had heard that the families and soldiers of their regiment were gathering at Sorel, so they made their way here as quickly as they could and arrived just two days ago."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","We have set up our tents in a small clearing that Father and the boys made, with a huge bonfire burning in the middle."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He taught me to whistle though.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",For a moment I thought I’d killed him.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",Hannah moans and tosses in her bed.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He will not even talk.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",That’s what gave this place its name: Chimney Point.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",And I’m so frightened!
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Two men stay in each boat to pole it.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He and John are scouting it out right now.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","We do not 
belong
 there any more, and that is what will surely happen if we return!"
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","One man registered his month-old baby as a major, and another registered his two dogs as his sons!"
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I suppose he is “well-favoured” though — I saw Hannah’s older sister Molly looking at him out of the corner of her eyes.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",She began bringing in food and fresh bedding for them and taking the soiled linens home to launder.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It branches out in different directions in several places.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Maybe that’s where it all is.)
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Now Father is teasing me mercilessly, saying that I must be sweet on him."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He told me that we’re going away up north to a place called Sorel, in Québec, on the St. Lawrence River."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“They hate us here,” he muttered, so low that I could hardly hear him."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",He doesn’t treat me at all like Angus’s bothersome little sister.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","We will be with friends and we will have the officers to help us.”
Uncle Andrew just puffed on his pipe and did not look convinced."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Father has tried to explain it to me.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Thank goodness it was shallow and I found my footing immediately.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Not that he isn’t here, of course, but it seems almost as if he is only here in his body."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",They are distributing our bowls of soup now.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Mother gave permission for her to share my bed tonight.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","So far we’ve just had small streams to deal with that were easy to ford, but this river is very wide and the current is fast."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",I was only thinking of Duncan’s friendship with Angus.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","I fairly gulped down my share of the milk, and my portion of bread was gone in three huge bites."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I was just so glad to see him that I loved it.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",He has already strapped two boys for no more than what Father would have considered normal high spirits.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I saw Lizzie looking out her window as we passed her house.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",And back to wormwood.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Baby Margaret has stopped fussing.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",But worn out.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",There is also something called nerve-vine.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Our campfire gives such a small circle of light, I imagine all kinds of wild beasts just lurking at the edge of it, staring at us."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Thank goodness for Grannie’s hearty meals every night and good breakfasts in the mornings.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Great consternation when he discovered the axes we have been issued are small ships’ axes and not nearly as suitable for the hard work we have in store for us as the larger ones he is used to.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",She said when she saw me she was as delighted to see someone else her own age as I was to see her.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I am 
so
 relieved to be across that river!"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They are really quite different.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Sometimes, if I stare up at the stars hard enough, it seems almost as if the world has turned topsy turvy and I am about to fall 
down
 into them."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I was cold and wet and it is snowing again.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","Father is worried, too, because we have only been issued with supplies for a month, although we have been assured that more supplies will follow us."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","It is much too late now to plant corn or potatoes, but Mother says we might get some beans and turnips in."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","As I write this, sitting on the riverbank and watching all the commotion, I can see the soldiers loading on tents and bales of cloth (a new dress this summer perhaps?)"
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Later
A near disaster!"
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","As if this month hasn’t been bad enough, it would have to have one extra day in it!"
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Then we can take it to a weaver.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",It just keeps on snowing and snowing.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","I suppose that is very bad of me, but I just have to do something."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","Angus and Duncan shot a deer in the forest and we had the most delicious, sizzling, juicy roast of venison I have ever tasted."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He is the kindest, gentlest man in the world."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",When I smell wormwood tea brewing I take myself off no matter how sickly I feel.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I carried baby Margaret for a good part of the way today, even though she is getting heavy."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Father has gone off to see about arranging for a boat.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",The reason it is so frightening is because the rapids are so very powerful.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",The families of the men and officers of Sir John Johnson’s Regiment will be established in a new settlement which has been called Johnstown in his honour.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",All the friendly and easy comradeship that had been between us was suddenly gone.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Grannie is chivvying me along.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Who will it be, here in this strange place?"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I reached out to her and then I started to cry too.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He and Mother hardly talk at all.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I told Father about Mr. Mitchell strapping the boys.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Father went off early this morning to talk to the officer in charge … Oh — I see him coming back now.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",He is lying down in his room now and I just heard a faint moan.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Smartweed steeped in vinegar for bruises and swellings.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","They could not leave them alight for long because of the danger of fire, but it was bonny while it lasted."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I keep thinking I hear her cry and looking around for her.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Obediah shook my hand most formally.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","“This is not the first home I have helped to build,” she said."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","They followed behind us and we didn’t see them, but John walked with us."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",It would seem Angus is as interested in her as she is in him.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","(I don’t believe I have 
nerves
!)"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Woebetide Jamie or me if we sit on it in the wagon!
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",I really do not understand that.
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",Angus said that he and Duncan saw a bear yesterday.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Our pails were full and we had both eaten our fill as well, so we whistled to Laddie and made ready to come home."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","How despairing he sounds, but tonight I do not feel lonely at all."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",Grannie was mightily pleased when Uncle Allan Ross said her squirrel stew was the tastiest dish there.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","“You see, Mary,” he repeated, “even though my mother saved Angus and me, my family are all rebels.”
I must have gasped, it was so unexpected."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","“When we have lost everything we owned, everything we ever worked for all these years because of our allegiance to Britain?"
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Hannah sent me a note and I have it here beside me.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","When we come to a rapids he directs the passage of the boats through, one by one."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",They have a village not too far from here.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We are 
Loyalists!"
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",He wears a fat money belt around his waist.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","But then, Hannah would also be my sister-in-law."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","When they are finished, Father says, all the families will draw lots for which piece of land we will own."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Hannah and I tore off our boots as soon as we got out of the boat and just raced along it.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","It was lovely, except that I was wild with impatience to see what was awaiting us on the other side."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I can’t imagine what it would have been like.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Church services this morning and church services again this evening.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Even Grannie!
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","I will write of 
that
 later."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Terrified he was when he saw that blood streaming out.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Margaret just won’t stop crying.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I gave Grannie a good boost from behind and normally she would have had my scalp for that, but not that morning."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","Oh, no he’s not."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Father’s face lit up like one of the German families’ Christmas trees.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Dear Canada: With Nothing But Our Courage
November 1783
Still on Lake Champlain
A good southerly breeze has sprung up again and we’re fairly flying along."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",When we reached the middle of the river old Blue was almost swimming.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","With worry, I suppose."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",But what was I supposed to do — let Tam drown?
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",But I guess that was better than what Angus and William had to do.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Snow has stopped and I would dearly love to go out and play in it but it’s Sunday.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It does not always follow close to the river and sometimes we have to stop while Father forces his way through the underbrush to make certain that we haven’t veered too far away from it.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",When we stumbled upon the blueberry patch we immediately set to picking and I lost all sense of time.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",It was one of her fine handkerchiefs that she had embroidered herself for her marriage chest.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I was the only one to see her go over as everyone else was busy getting ready to get off the boat.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Their names are Annie Stanton and Flossie Hoople.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",And how they bite!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",(Father told me how to spell it.)
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",The baby was fast asleep in a cradle beside the hearth and never cried once the whole time we were there.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",They are even planning a school for next year.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",The school is in a shanty on the other side of the settlement.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Best of all, we do not have to get back on the boat tonight!"
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Uncle Allan will be entitled to 200 acres because he is a non-commissioned officer.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",For a moment it felt just like old times.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","She is propped up in a bed beside the hearth, well tucked in."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",He can look more mournful than any other dog I’ve ever seen.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",She has developed a funny little laugh that sounds just like a tiny rooster crowing.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We have reached the Hudson River and Father says we will follow its valley north from here on.

ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",He will stay over the night and then go on and visit the other families as well.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Still snowing!
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","He said that out of Mother’s hearing, however, as she refuses to hear of us not returning to New York Province in the spring."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","He has been lying down in there ever since, and Mother has been cooling his cheek with one of Grannie’s poultices."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","They are dressed in such ragged uniforms, they look like scarecrows."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I cannot believe how high the hills are here!
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","Truly, it is just as well that she doesn’t try to go to school, as the weather has been very cold and stormy — one blizzard after another, it seems."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",I balanced a yoke over my shoulders and let a bucket hang down from each side of it.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","That means “Good morning.”
Again, we are packed in so tightly there is scarce room to breathe."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Too busy to write much these past few days — and too tired.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I lie awake at night sometimes and hear the rustlings and noises in the bush around me and I cannot help but be afraid, even though Father keeps the fire going throughout the night."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","For a moment I thought he was going to speak to her, but then George fell into the fire and created a stir."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",She doesn’t seem to be nursing very well and Mother is fretting.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Mother is feeding baby Margaret, but I can see from here that she is shaking so much that it’s making the baby fretful."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","“My father and brothers and I had a terrible fight when this war broke out,” he said, poking at the ground with a stick."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Margaret continues poorly.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Angus and Duncan came just about the same time as the Rosses and helped us unload their wagon.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",“Why must you insist on believing we still belong back in Albany?
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",It will surely be too late to plant crops by the time we are settled.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",While we wait I will describe what it is like here.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","“After that we’ll be going back home, of course,” Mother snapped."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I heard Father grunt with pain and my stomach took a lurch.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","And it is 
so
 dark!"
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","If
 we receive more supplies."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He and the dog make a very woebegone, wet pair."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Actually, it’s probably because Grannie 
does
 nag at me all the time that I have become so good."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Still, it will be better than sleeping out in the woods."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Perhaps writing in this journal will take my mind off the dangers out there, real or imagined."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Grannie thought otherwise, and after she rapped my knuckles sharply with her spoon, just because I dipped a finger into the honey pot, she banished us out of the house."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It is my job to collect wood for the fire and I got to it right smartly.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“There 
is
 no road,” Father growled back."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I’m rather proud of that, although it drives Grannie wild."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Poor old Blue, I don’t think he’s ever felt such a lash in his whole life."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Jamie just sat up to ask me what I was doing.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Father says that that’s hypocrisy, though."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","When Mr. Livingstone opened the door to greet us, the smell of that goose absolutely overwhelmed me."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",He brought news that the road will be through to the town next spring.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","I try to keep baby Margaret as dry as I can, but she cries constantly."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I suppose she doesn’t consider that kind of behaviour proper for a young girl.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Poor little Tam.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",It is hard to believe that this wild place can ever be home.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Mother had sent us berry picking and I was so relieved to have a rest from work.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",We have reached the top of Lake Champlain and are in Québec.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I used to complain about always having so much work to do; now I find it hard not to have something to occupy my time.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",It tasted so good!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“Oh, well, I’m sure there’ll be blackberries aplenty in Canada.”
She does seem to be able to “put a good face on things,” as Grannie says, although it is obvious that she is making an effort."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Mother is busy making shirts for Father and the boys out of the buckskins that Father tanned.

ch3,"December 1st, 1783",The cabin was saved but it will have to have a new roof.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",You’d never know she’s had as hard a time as I have — she just fairly bubbles over with talk.
ch14,"November 1st, 1784",It is fortunate that the light was so dim as I knew my face was flaming with embarrassment.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","We couldn’t believe it, but sure enough, out of the trees came a horse and rider."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","The boatmen have made a huge bonfire in order to dry out, as several of them got very wet."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",He came over late this afternoon.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",I shouldn’t have asked questions of you about your family.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",And there was more good news as well.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",“Is it not enough that we have only a few short months to prepare ourselves for winter?” he thundered.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","I will not miss him, but I wonder how long it will be until a school is built here?"
ch14,"November 1st, 1784","I had not changed into my nightdress yet, so I gathered up my courage and crept down the ladder."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",At least it would be another warm body up here.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",There are more Indians around than I’ve ever seen before.

ch12,"September 6th, 1784","Father tried to talk to them, but they are from the Mississauga tribe and Father does not know their language."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Bits of wood and litter were strewn all over the place.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Thank goodness the land has flattened out here.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Not like the last one.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",It is snug and well-chinked and I’m sure he will be very comfortable in it this winter.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","He has a really 
really
 loud voice."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",The only good thing is that Mittens leaped out of the way just in time.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I think I can smell snow in the air.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Angus and Duncan shot four squirrels today and Mother is making a squirrel stew.

ch7,"April 6th, 1784","Softly, quietly, an old Scottish lullaby."

ch12,"September 6th, 1784","Not that the privy ever smells sweet, no matter how much lye we throw down into it, but it does help."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Duncan is so courteous.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","“For our Mary’s special birthday dinner,” he announced."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","He did not catch anything, probably because Laddie was leaping around in the water most of the time."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",The poor wee baby.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","“I was afraid that if your family knew they would not want me around.”
“They would never feel that way,” I burst out."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","I can see forests stretching out on both sides of us, but no hills to speak of."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",At least until the snow comes.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",Her mouth got all grim looking.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",This morning she took Hannah and me along as well.
ch14,"November 1st, 1784",Nor do I want to.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Not nearly as much as they are aching now, though, even though Grannie gave me a good rubbing with her smartweed concoction."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Hannah says her father said that the man who bought the oxen gloated over the fact that he had given Mr. Ross the lowest price possible.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",I really did believe the walls would fall down.

ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","Grannie was there with her ladle to test it and when she dipped it in and a long, stretchy thread hung down from the ladle, she pronounced the syrup done."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",I begin to hope that she has even resigned herself to the fact that we will not be going home.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",As if I could!
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I could almost believe he’d never left except for the fact that he is so thin and he looks so much older and so very tired.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Hannah and I walk together, but we are both so encumbered that we can hardly speak."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","Dear Canada: With Nothing But Our Courage
August 1784
It is hard to believe that summer is nearing its end."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",Aunt Norah says Hannah might be able to come out for a short time tomorrow.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Father was right to worry about the lateness of the season.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Father said prayers with us after breakfast, but still refused to stay put for the day."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Fort St. Jean
A near disaster today!"
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",Grannie made Jamie and me go into our tent and stay there.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Well, we are here."

ch2,"November 1st, 1783",A woman gave us a whole pan of milk and some fresh bread today.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Machiche itself is crammed full of people like us, Loyalists who have escaped from the Colonies."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Maybe they needed it to get their courage up for what they did.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","“But I shudder to think of the work ahead of us,” she said."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Now I think about it a great deal:
He sank into the Lowland, Lowland, Low
He sank into the Lowland Sea."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",The rain has stopped.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","It is a lovely feeling to be sailing over the water so freely, and the waves are not quite so frightening."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","Father was stretched out on his back, snoozing — just about the first time I’ve seen him so at ease since we settled here — and he was not about to move, so only Jamie and Laddie and I accompanied Duncan."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","“I would have stood up all night!”
“We were there for months, Mouse,” he answered, with a peculiar twist to his mouth."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",We attacked the forest today.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","“Of course we’ll return,” she says."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We haven’t had a word from him in months, but we know he was right in the thick of it all."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",One of the men slipped and fell right into the water and I heard him shout out something that I suspect might have been a swear word.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",And she’s not.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","She couldn’t bear to lose Angus as well, I’m sure, and neither could I, although when he was home he used to tease me to death and was always at me for being so clumsy."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","We say “
Bon jour”
 to them every morning."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","Everyone grabbed up tarpaulins, blankets, anything they could reach, and began beating at the flames."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","“I suppose we can.”
It’s been so long since I’ve seen them like this with each other."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",We served the supper.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","Duncan’s shanty is much like Angus’s, but he has put in one small window."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",We worked for the whole day and finished the quilt off by late afternoon.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Angus has given me the cage he brought Mittens in to carry her in.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Father says it’s the acid in the urine that does it.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","It is large, but at night the five of us are quite squashed up together."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","“Be quick with you now,” she ordered Angus and Duncan, “before the guards see you."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","Dear Canada: With Nothing But Our Courage
May 1784
We are to be out of here by May 10th."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",How I wish things could be as they were.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We leave today.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","For some reason I could not speak of it to anyone, not even Hannah."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Do you want to see me tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail — possibly even hanged?
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",How to describe it?
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",To think that they are going to be sold to a stranger!
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","When you arrive at the place chosen for you, I’ll join you there.”
Mother’s face darkened."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Thank Providence Father had a whole big bottle of ink at home that he had not yet got around to taking to the school, so I will be well supplied with that for quite some time."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","“Give Janet this,” she said, and ran back into her room before I could answer her."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I do not feel any better at all.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Scots go to church on Christmas Day and have our festivities on New Year’s Eve when we celebrate Hogmanay; but we’ll be celebrating Christmas as well this year because Mrs. Livingstone is going to invite us to her house for a grand Christmas dinner.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",I don’t think we’ll be going back home.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Father says that for now we are heading for a place called Chimney Point.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784",The first-foot did come!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Mother must have been just as surprised because she leapt to her feet as well.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","I feel sorry for Obediah and Lisa, having to work for such an unpleasant family."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Mother is beginning to talk more, but now she is worrying about Angus."
ch7,"April 6th, 1784",He could fight no longer and their neighbours were set to hang him for a traitor if he stayed.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",“It was not rude at all.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","He ran up to Jamie and pressed himself against Jamie’s legs, then turned to face the bushes again and growled."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",Jamie was determined to catch a fish so Duncan fixed up a pole and line for him and he and Laddie spent the next hour at the stream.
ch7,"April 6th, 1784","Hannah and I danced together until her mother made her stop, then we just sat and watched the others."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Mr. Murchison sat with Mother for a while and prayed with us.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","I knew we had strayed too far from home, but the day was so fine and I was in an exploring mood."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",I am looking forward to an egg.
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","That brings its own worries, however."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",“Use that pass and be out of here by morning!” he cried.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",Perhaps too good.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Tomorrow he will start on the chimney.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","The Indians are camped out of sight, but near us."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",It’s on a big lake north of here called Lake Champlain.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",That is a good enough present for now.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He and Mother even had words.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","I don’t want to, either."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Her father has sold their wagon and oxen too, and most of their possessions."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","It will be years before the trees will be big enough to bear fruit, but I can wait."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",The cool sand felt glorious between my toes.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",He must have been starving.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",My boots will surely not last another month.
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","Father scoffs at her, but she will not be convinced otherwise."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","She looked around, then back at him."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",What fun to wear Indian moccasins!
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",They have had trouble with the rebel patrols and hope that if they are journeying with us things might go a little easier for them.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We are four families in the boat and we are very squished, sitting three or four to a seat."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","“So soft,” she said."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",It took them quite a while.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",That’s what makes the bread rise.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I tuck it carefully into a corner of the wagon each morning, well protected by my bundle of clothes."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Father admits that much of what the rebels claimed was just — the British 
were
 interfering too much in our affairs, and levying unreasonable taxes upon us."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",He propped up a net with sticks and when they landed it fell on them.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",Grannie’s little lilac bush has bloomed!
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",I have never seen him so angry.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",“I just can’t.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",That was when I made a big mistake.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","Before anyone realized what he was doing, he had hoisted an axe and aimed a mighty blow at one of the logs."
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784",Up until now I’ve only been allowed to thread needles.
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","“And so little time before winter sets in.”
Father’s face cleared and he smiled a huge smile."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",They catch them in snares.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",Baby Margaret is grizzling again.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","And just now, as I was about to climb the ladder up to my bed here in the loft, Grannie stopped me."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","But I have to now, don’t I?"
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Mother is furious and sad and desperate all at the same time.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","Twice as big as me he is, and he cried like a baby."
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",So he should be.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",Mother was very disapproving because a jug of whiskey appeared when they were finished and was being passed around quite liberally.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Next to Laddie, of course, who is snoring by the hearth as I write this."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",And he brought chickens!
ch6,"March 3rd, 1784","I am practising like mad so that I will be allowed to help, and rubbing my hands with goose grease every night so they won’t be too rough and scratchy."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784",One of them shot a brace of squirrels and the stew they are making smells wonderful.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783",My tears are blotting the paper and making a terrible mess.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","We talked about what had happened during the day, what I had learned at school, our farm — anything and everything that came to mind."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","I thought they would be a terrible nuisance, but the teacher, Mr. Mitchell, is very good at keeping order."
ch4,"January 1st, 1784","No one has said so, but I can see it in their faces."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Of course the first thing it did was to shake all over me.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784",Even Grannie’s remedies do not seem to help it.
ch12,"September 6th, 1784",And I probably would have.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","She says that all boys are dolts and she wouldn’t want to have anything to do with any of them, much less Alex Calder."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","We are tired, of course, but I think it is more than that."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","Several of the others are around my age, only a few are older — all boys."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",We have to save all our breath for the climbing.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784","“Only Angus knows,” he said."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","The Rosses, as usual, are close beside us."
ch12,"September 6th, 1784","They have huge canoes that hold around ten men, and they use a flaming torch called a jack light at the bow to attract the fish."
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","I would have thought he would have looked as excited as Angus was at the telling — proud even, of his mother — but no such thing."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","I suppose it is a sad song, about a young cabin boy who is betrayed by his captain and left to drown, but we used to sing out the chorus as loudly as we could with all the will in the world, Father’s voice bellowing out over all of ours, and we never once thought about what the words were saying."
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","A sorry, grimy place it is."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I miss the safety of our snug little house.
ch2,"November 1st, 1783","Even though he’s only five years older than I he seems so much older and so different now, I’m almost afraid of him."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",Grannie’s lilac bush is beside me.
ch8,"May 2nd, 1784","There are thousands of people gathered here, from military settlements as far downriver as Québec City, and the confusion, noise and general disarray is truly alarming."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783",I will write of it anyway and see if that makes me feel any better.
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","Mind you, I was a little concerned myself."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784","I’m sure Mother’s are the same but she does not complain, so neither will I."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",I find that I’m not getting tired at all now.
ch9,"June 1st, 1784","It sounded very generous to me, but Mother had something to say about that."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Grannie says we must take as many pots as possible but we won’t be able to carry many, and certainly not the iron skillets."
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","The two boys took Jamie in hand the minute we were inside, and were soon playing a game of knuckle bones with him."
ch1,"October 6th, 1783",Grannie bustles around with her mouth set in that grim line I know so well.
ch1,"October 6th, 1783","Jamie, of course, can hardly speak for excitement."
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784",But we will have a snug cabin to live in for the winter.
ch3,"December 1st, 1783","It is not much, but it is the best we can do."
ch10,"July 2nd, 1784",I wonder how I would like having bossy Molly as a sister-in-law?
ch11,"August 2nd, 1784","Angus came by today to tell us how his shanty is coming along, and he brought us some dishes and spoons that he had whittled out of poplar wood."
ch5,"February 1st, 1784","We do have a drop spindle, the one I learned to spin on, but we have no wool to spin even on it."
ch9,"June 1st, 1784",The others get out and walk along the shore and pull the boat through with ropes.
ch13,"October 3rd, 1784",What he told me next is burned into my memory.
